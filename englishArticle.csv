Recycling Mystery: Rechargeable Tool Batteries,"Many power tools use batteries to run instead of corded electricity or the muscle of the user. You can find rechargeable batteries in a variety of common household power tools such as drills, drivers, saws, blowers, work lights, and trimmers. Most people find it more convenient to use battery-powered tools than to be tethered to an electrical outlet. And rechargeable batteries are easy to charge when their power runs low. However, eventually, these batteries wear out and need to be disposed of. Are rechargeable tool batteries recyclable?

Rechargeable Batteries 101
Rechargeable batteries work the same way that standard batteries do. Both make power by means of an electrochemical reaction involving an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte. In a rechargeable battery, the reaction has the capability to be reversible but a standard battery does not. A rechargeable battery is recharged by reversing the negative-to-positive electron flow that occurs during use. This resets the battery cells’ charge, making the battery usable again.
Common types of rechargeable batteries include lithium-ion (Li-ion), lithium-ion polymer (LiPo), lead-acid, nickel-cadmium (NiCad), and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH). But most home power tools use the familiar Li-ion batteries. These are also commonly used in electronic devices such as cellphones, laptops, and tablets. Li-ion batteries use lithium ions to move from the negative electrode to the positive electrode during use and then back again when charging. Today, Li-ion batteries hold a charge longer, can be used in a wide range of temperatures, and are lighter than other battery varieties.
The Need To Recycle
It’s very important to recycle spent rechargeable batteries as they can be very volatile. When not properly sorted, carefully transported, and safely taken apart, battery components can easily cause fires and even explosions. To visualize this hazard, watch Mythbusters Junior’s demonstration of how common batteries can cause fires when compacted as could happen in a garbage truck.
Additionally, batteries contain many reusable materials. Recycled lithium-ion batteries can be made into new batteries, steel, or stainless steel products. Nickel-based batteries can also be recycled into new batteries or products such as cutlery, golf clubs, and cooking tools.
And if you need another reason to recycle your batteries, it is illegal to dispose of them incorrectly in many states in the U.S. Some states require that producers offer or fund battery collection events.
Rechargeable Battery Recycling
Power tool rechargeable battery recycling has become commonplace in much of the U.S.
Most major cities should have a few locations where you can drop off batteries for recycling. Search Earth911’s recycling database or Call2Recycle’s specific battery recycling locator to find a location near you to find a recycling location for your spent tool batteries.
Most Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Staples stores accept rechargeable batteries for recycling in conjunction with Call2Recycle.
DeWalt also accepts rechargeable tool batteries from any manufacturer for recycling at their service locations, free of charge. The company designated October as National Power Tool Battery Recycling Month in 2008. But no matter what month it is, recycling your rechargeable batteries is the right thing to do.

8 Ways Activated Charcoal Can Help You Heal & Detox,"When you think of charcoal, your olfactory receptors may invoke the aroma of skewers on the barbie or a cozy campfire. However, there are miraculous benefits of this chalky black substance. Turns out, charcoal, which is derived from carbon, isn’t limited to cooking or snuggling fireside.
Activated charcoal is created through a process that infuses oxygen to create millions of tiny pores over a surface area. This porosity allows for the absorption of odors and other organic chemicals, toxins and gases, making it ideal for detoxification.
Charcoal boasts many superpowers, but not all charcoal is created equal. Sustainable charcoal, the ideal choice, is made from sustainably managed forests that use ecologically sound harvesting methods and kiln techniques for better efficiency. Bamboo charcoal is a superior choice due to its inherent absorption properties and rapid renewability.
Need some guidance? Check out these eight surprising uses and health benefits of activated charcoal.
1. Reduce Acne and Prevent Breakouts
If you’ve got oily skin, don’t hide that beautiful face. Instead, scrub annoying breakouts away with the Bamboo Charcoal Dew Puff. I personally use this and can sing its praises, especially in the shower (I’ll spare you the high notes). While it’s initially hard to the touch, once wet, the Dew Puff melts in your fingertips, allowing you to scrub your face gently while the activated carbon and minerals do their thang. This sponge is all natural and derived from the Asian konjac root (as a vegan, something I delight in). So, while this sponge is (almost) safe enough to eat, it’ll help prevent future acne while the antioxidants fight bacteria. At a mere $8, your wallet — and your flawless, zit-free skin — will thank you.

2. Cleanse Your Body

Speaking of scrubbing away toxins, the pureSOL biodegradable, 100 percent natural sponge is also made from the konjac root and contains activated charcoal and minerals for further exfoliation and detoxing by absorbing sebum (buildup) and dirt from your skin.
Yes, I also have this hanging in my shower and love that it’s chemical-free and 100 percent natural. It uses zero chemicals to process; just a steam method of the root plant fibers. The pureSOL Konjac Body Sponge not only detoxifies, but also hydrates your largest organ while balancing the pH levels. The woven fibers stimulate blood flow and promote cell growth. Say hello to smaller pore sizes and goodbye to impurities.
And just to be a bit more bragalicious, this sponge can be composted into your flower pot when you’re finished. It comes in 90 percent compostable packaging. Dang — is there anything this sponge can’t do? Oh, right, it’s vegan, cruelty-free and sustainable.

3. Polish Skin on the Go
7th Heaven knows its powers and has created two products that are perfect for that special night out or on the road:
Their Charcoal Mud Mask is a convenient face masque that uses black lava, naturally purifying charcoal, and exfoliating walnut seeds. This all-natural combo helps tackle impurities deep within the skin without preservatives, foaming agents or harsh chemicals typically found in personal care items.
7th Heaven’s Charcoal Deep Pore cleaner contains natural hardwood charcoal to absorb dirt and sebum, banish dreaded blackheads, and reduce visible pores around the nose. Volcanic ash helps clear away dead skin cells.

4. Filter Your Water
Most local water companies add chlorine or chloramines to your water supply to kill bacteria and microorganisms. Activated charcoal or activated carbon is routinely used in household water filtration systems because it chemically bonds with contaminants like chlorine and/or chlorine taste and odor to remove them from the water. This, combined with a multi-stage water filtration, is best to address additional contaminants.
5. Detox Your Body
How about removing nasty pesticides and chemicals and clearing your skin by ingesting activated charcoal? I did. Why? Because, according to Ben Johnson, M.D., “Acne isn’t a skin issue, it’s caused from poor digestion linked to what we eat and hormonal imbalances internally, not topical bacteria.” He created Osmosis Skin Defense Environmental Detox, which binds the toxins before they reach the skin. The activated charcoal acts like a sponge to absorb toxins and harmful compounds, while decreasing the workload of the liver to aid in overall detoxification.

6. Whiten Teeth
Why resort to harsh bleach to get those pearly whites to shimmer when you can whiten them with activated charcoal, all the while fighting stains and preventing cavities, gingivitis, and bacteria buildup? Say bye-bye to coffee and red wine stains and hello to shine! This all-natural Bamboo Charcoal Whitening & Anti-Stain Toothpaste might look strange, but your bright smile won’t.
7. Reduce Bloating
Cold-pressed juiceries are all the rage right now, and charcoal-infused elixirs and cocktails are the new muse for today’s mixologists.
My personal favorite to reduce bloating and draw out toxins for vibrant skin is the Charcoal Skinny Lemonade from Nekter Juice Bar. It’s made with filtered water, lemon, agave nectar and, you guessed it, coconut charcoal. It’s healthy, delicious, and a definite conversation starter.
8. Absorb Odors
How about an effective, fragrance-free, odorless, and nontoxic solution to absorb unwanted odors? Before you reach for that toxic, synthetic “freshener” to cover up smells, get to the source of the stench! Remodeez is a chemical-free, natural odor remover that uses activated charcoal (derived from coconut husks) to absorb and naturally neutralize odors. You can place these deodorizers anywhere — in your shoes, the fridge, a trash can, your car, or anywhere at home. Plus, they last up to a year and can be recharged by placing them in the sun.

How To Cook Up a Zero-Waste Kitchen,"If your family is anything like ours, the kitchen is easily the most used room in the house. With three children, a dog, and two adults to care for, the waste can really pile up if we let it.
For our family, part of living a more conscious lifestyle is taking a look at the everyday things in our lives and becoming aware of their values and shortcomings — and looking for ways to make them better for living and better for our communities and world.
These are a few of the tips we use to not only reduce our waste but also simplify our lives and feel better in the process.

Food Storage
Plastic storage is not only wasteful, it’s unhealthy. Single-use baggies go straight into the trash, and even the “best” of plastic storage bins will eventually wear out, discolor, break, or warp — ultimately ending up in a landfill.
Switching to reusable containers offers a variety of benefits. While the costs to get started can be more, the investment will pay off in the long run, and glass bowls are especially versatile. We use ours for mixing, cooking, and storage.
Below are a few of our favorite reusables for your zero-waste kitchen:

Wean Green and Pyrex glass storage containers
Jars (save money by cleaning used food jars and lids to use as storage containers!)
Reusable snack bags take the place of their plastic counterparts
Planetbox and other stainless, reusable lunch containers

You can even purchase devices for your fridge that can help extend the life of produce. I’ve been using a BerryBreeze (an activated oxygen gadget) for the past few months and have found that it definitely keeps fruits and veggies fresh longer, helping reduce food waste.
What to Do With “Waste”
Image courtesy of Kirsty Hall
My first tip: Buy only what you need. This seems like a no-brainer, but keeping impulse purchases to a minimum will reduce potential waste, and it’ll be much kinder to your budget too.
Next, try to buy products with little to no packaging, and choose something that can be reused or recycled if no packaging isn’t an option. Packaging waste may not be entirely avoidable, but always consider what you’ll do with the packaging before you purchase an item.
Shopping bulk foods, local farmers, and markets are all great ways to help you avoid packaging. Be sure to bring your own egg cartons, berry containers, etc.
Some ideas for reusing packaging:

Yogurt (and other) containers can be used to sprout seeds, grow an herb garden, and more.
Reuse glass jars for fridge food storage and plastic jars for storing craft supplies, small tools, nails and screws, and more
Find more great ideas on my ReUse Pinterest board!

Last but not least, compost or recycle anything that can’t possibly be used. Reusing is ideal, so you may consider Freecycling items that you no longer use but are still in usable condition.
Cleanup
Cleanup starts with the obvious — ditch the single-use paper items! Cloth napkins, rags, and “unpaper towels” will get the job done better and without the constant need to buy more.
I bought about three dozen cheap washcloths from a big box store for a few dollars per dozen. I’ve been using the same cloths to clean with for about five years now. I’m much happier with cloth, as they really do grab better and they don’t leave behind paper fibers.
Cloth napkins are another easy change. You can easily buy some, but making them is pretty easy too. I used some fabric I had been given, but you could easily use old dress shirts or blouses.
Cleaning supplies are a big way to reduce the amount of packaging coming in, and the amount of money going out. A bottle of truly nontoxic cleaner could cost upwards for $4 per bottle. You can buy a gallon of vinegar for less than that and it will refill a bottle (50/50 with water) many times over. Add in your favorite essential oils for some extra cleaning power, or for a friendly scent.
Shopping Trips

Plan Before You Shop
Stores spend a lot of time and money organizing their aisles to keep you there longer, which generally leads to you spending more money. All of this can be avoided by knowing what you need.
Keeping a good grocery list is a great place to start. And you can save even more by taking the time to create a meal plan or use a meal-planning app. Even a flexible plan will result in big savings. You’ll find that you spend less time in the store, less money on things you don’t need, and you’ll also have fewer trips to the store. As a bonus, you’ll be less inclined to order dinner or eat out because you’ll be more likely to have the items you need to create a meal.
Reduce Packaging Waste
Did you know there’s a growing number of zero-waste grocery stores around the world? I had no idea. Hopefully one will open up near my home soon.
When shopping, you can eliminate a big source of waste simply by bringing your own shopping bags. Plastic or paper? No thanks, I brought my own! You can even buy your own reusable produce bags. Within a few trips using them will be second nature, and if you forget them, buy a new one. You’ll learn quickly and you can never have too many reusable bags.
Another great way to cut down on costs and packaging is to ditch store-bought beverages. Water is cheap and you can buy an affordable filter these days if that’s of concern to you. If you prefer flavors, that’s easy too. Infused water is delicious, and adding things like lemon may even have some great health effects.
For coffee and tea lovers like myself, coffee grounds and tea leaves are perfect for composting. And even if you like the ease of a single cup brewer, there are stainless steel reusable K Cups. I adore my EkoBrew, too.
While these tips might not entirely eliminate waste, every step will get you closer, and that’s something you can feel good about. Bonus: Start-up costs aside, all of these tips can lead to big savings.

Cleaning supplies are a big way to reduce the amount of packaging coming in, and the amount of money going out. A bottle of truly nontoxic cleaner could cost upwards for $4 per bottle. You can buy a gallon of vinegar for less than that and it will refill a bottle (50/50 with water) many times over. Add in your favorite essential oils for some extra cleaning power, or for a friendly scent. Shopping Trips Reusable produce bags. Image courtesy of Kate Fisher Plan Before You Shop Stores spend a lot of time and money organizing their aisles to keep you there longer, which generally leads to you spending more money. All of this can be avoided by knowing what you need. Keeping a good grocery list is a great place to start. And you can save even more by taking the time to create a meal plan or use a meal-planning app. Even a flexible plan will result in big savings. You’ll find that you spend less time in the store, less money on things you don’t need, and you’ll also have fewer trips to the store. As a bonus, you’ll be less inclined to order dinner or eat out because you’ll be more likely to have the items you need to create a meal. Reduce Packaging Waste Did you know there’s a growing number of zero-waste grocery stores around the world? I had no idea. Hopefully one will open up near my home soon. When shopping, you can eliminate a big source of waste simply by bringing your own shopping bags. Plastic or paper? No thanks, I brought my own! You can even buy your own reusable produce bags. Within a few trips using them will be second nature, and if you forget them, buy a new one. You’ll learn quickly and you can never have too many reusable bags. Another great way to cut down on costs and packaging is to ditch store-bought beverages. Water is cheap and you can buy an affordable filter these days if that’s of concern to you. If you prefer flavors, that’s easy too. Infused water is delicious, and adding things like lemon may even have some great health effects. For coffee and tea lovers like myself, coffee grounds and tea leaves are perfect for composting. And even if you like the ease of a single cup brewer, there are stainless steel reusable K Cups. I adore my EkoBrew, too. While these tips might not entirely eliminate waste, every step will get you closer, and that’s something you can feel good about. Bonus: Start-up costs aside, all of these tips can lead to big savings.

How Many Times Can That Be Recycled?,"I used to think that plastic water bottles could be infinitely recycled, that every time I tossed one into the blue bin, it eventually came out to be another plastic bottle. As it turns out, that’s not the case. Some materials can be recycled infinitely, but plastic is not one of them.
So if a recyclable isn’t reborn as the original item, where does it go? I found out most recyclable items are recycled down (or “downcycled”). That means your water bottle may turn into a synthetic fabric or material for a park bench.
But can that park bench be recycled? Can my “recycled” notebook be re-recycled? Just how many times can that material be recycled?
Editor’s note: This post contains affiliate links, which helps fund our Recycling Directory, the most comprehensive in North America.
Plastic: Once or twice
When it is recycled, the quality of the plastic decreases. So, most of the time, plastic is downcycled into something like plastic lumber or synthetic fibers for fabric or insulation. It’s not going to become another plastic water bottle or whatever it was originally. And then it’s no longer recyclable; you can’t throw the shoe or sweater made from plastic bottles into your blue bin once it goes out of style.
So once that item made from recycled plastic item is no longer wanted, it will likely end up in a landfill. There, it will eventually break down into microplastics that will just sit there for eternity — or worse, leach out into the environment. So the next time you think it’s fine to buy plastics because they can be recycled, remember they’re usually recycled once or twice and then no more.
One great way to reduce your plastic waste is to avoid single-use plastics by carrying your own water bottle, reusable straw, flatware, and to-go containers when you go out. Some great alternatives are stainless steel water bottles and bamboo utensils.
Aluminum: Infinite
Your soda cans can be recycled an unlimited number of times. Yes, you read that right: infinite. Aluminum cans are the most valuable recycled item in the United States and have the highest return rate from the time the can is dropped off at a recycling center or picked up by your garbage man. Next time you’re thirsty, I highly suggest you grab a cold drink in a can, not a plastic bottle. Just be sure to pop it in the recycling bin when you’re done!
Other Metals: Infinite
Metals are categorized into ferrous and non-ferrous metals. All metals have an unlimited lifespan, and it is always a good idea to recycle them, regardless of how much you have. If you’re interested in how much cash you can make by being an eco-warrior, read The Basics of Recycling Scrap Metal for Money.
Paper: 5 to 7
Paper is almost as tricky as plastic. It’s made up of long fibers, so every time paper is recycled, those fibers will be shortened, making it harder to be recycled the next time.
The average number of times your printer paper can be recycled is about five to seven times. After that, the fibers will become too short and can’t be made into copier paper anymore. At that point, the short fibers can be used to make things like newsprint or egg cartons.
If you want to get an idea of how it works, try recycling your own paper into new paper!
Glass: Infinite
Last but definitely not least is glass. So am I harming the environment by using glass as my container of choice? Absolutely not! Glass, like metal, can be recycled an unlimited number of times. Also, it is more cost-effective to reuse and recycle glass than to create from scratch,
The only thing you have to watch out for is the type of glass. Be sure to ask your local recycling center which types of glass they accept, as different types of glass have different melting points and can’t be recycled together. Think of it this way: if you tried melting coconut oil and a piece of chocolate, the chocolate would melt slower and therefore they wouldn’t be done at the same time.
Generally, container glass (bottles and jars) can be recycled, but do check with your local recycling program. Non-container glass (like windows, mirrors, and glassware) generally cannot be recycled.
All in all, you’re a superhero if you recycle in the first place, especially if you live somewhere without a government-funded program. But now that I know metals and glass containers are the best way to go, I will always choose them first — regardless of access to recycling facilities.

5 No-Kill Strategies for Getting Rid of Mice,"Although you might think mice are cute and furry, you probably don’t want them living in your home or garage. They can carry hard-to-pronounce diseases and cause property damage. Plus, they leave little droppings all around.
A small problem can quickly get out of hand. Mice can have eight litters a year, with five to six young per litter. That means one female mouse can produce 48 young in one year — and think of all the babies her young can breed!
You can take alternative approaches to rid your home of mice, and many of them are effective long-term strategies. Even if you don’t have mice in your home now, it is a good idea to follow strategies one and two to prevent a mouse infestation before it starts.
This article contains affiliate links. If you purchase an item through one of these links, we receive a small commission that helps fund our Recycling Directory.
Strategy 1 – Make Your Home Difficult for Mice to Enter
Unfortunately, our homes are attractive to mice because they can provide shelter and food. Just as you might make your house an unattractive target for thieves, you can make it difficult to penetrate for rodents. Steel wool is an excellent tool because mice can’t chew through it.
Go around the exterior and interior of your home and look for any slits or holes that are ½ inch or larger. Basically, this would be anything that is the size of a dime or larger. Fill up these gaps with steel wool and then apply caulk to seal them up.
If there are vents on a crawl space or around an HVAC system, seal up any gaps. A prime location is where pipes run through the wall. Mice are very agile and are good climbers. Finally, if you have vines or non-structural architectural features that run up and down your home, remove them if possible.
If you already have mice in your home, examine places where mice can go from room to room within the home, especially into the kitchen or pantry, where you are likely to store food. One common route is along pipes, so check wherever pipes penetrate a wall, such as under a sink, and seal up any holes.
Easy to access food will attract mice, so secure any animal feed and locate bird feeders away from the house. Photo: Gaertringen, Pixabay
Strategy 2 – Be a Poor Host and Don’t Feed These Unwanted Visitors
If you have bird feeders, birdseed, animal feed, or other food sources on the outside of your home or in a garage, this will help attract mice to your home. If possible, relocate a bird feeder far from the house — 50 or more feet away. Avoid feeding pets outdoors, especially if they don’t eat all the food at once or leave some residue. Store pet food, animal feed, and birdseed in metal bins with tight-fitting lids, and beware of spilling when you access the containers.
Unfortunately, backyard chickens and compost piles can be a source of food for rodents. To prevent this, put chicken feed away at night, consider buying a rat-proof chicken feeder or making one from a 5-gallon bucket. Also, follow these steps to keep them out of your compost pile.
Strategy 3 – Use No-Kill Mousetraps
Mice often walk along walls when they scamper around. Thus, placing box traps along the base of the wall is an excellent way to catch the little critters in action. Some of them don’t require bait, are big enough so you can snag multiple mice in one trap, and are reusable many times. So, you can knock out a serious infestation more quickly and without buying numerous items.
Another option is to make or buy a bucket trap. These devices use a 5-gallon bucket and bate to lure the mouse or even small rats onto a lid. If they step in the right location, the rodent tilts the top and falls into the bucket. These traps are also reusable and can catch multiple mice.
Here is a simple DIY no-kill mousetrap you can make at home using a 5-gallon bucket. If you have the time, experiment with different designs to see which one works best.

Unfortunately, using a no-kill mousetrap does require relocating the mice to a more appealing location far from your home. If you don’t do this, the mice might be right back in your home again. Also, if the mice stay in the trap too long (without food), they will die. Therefore, this approach does require a time commitment and checking the traps regularly.
If you do end up using a trap that kills the mice, the snap traps usually kill the mice quickly. The same is not true for glue traps, which lead to a longer death than snap traps, causing the mouse to suffer. Glue traps are also more likely to catch other species that aren’t of concern. Snap traps — and especially poison — can be harmful to pets and children. Poisoned mice may die and rot in the walls, creating odor and bacteria issues. Also, other animals can eat the poisoned mouse and become sick.
Strategy 4 – Spray Peppermint Essential Oils
Supposedly, mice hate the smell of peppermint, and the scent irritates their nasal passages. So spraying something that contains peppermint essential oils can cause mice to move out. Keep in mind, this spray could hamper plans to catch mice in traps. So, use the spray where you don’t plan to locate traps.
Like the bucket trap, you could either buy a spray or go DIY. If you purchase a spray, make sure you look for a natural, nontoxic peppermint oil spray.
To make a mouse repellent spray, combine 2 teaspoons of peppermint essential oil with 1 cup of water and add a couple of drops of dishwashing detergent. Another approach is to use undiluted peppermint oil on cotton balls and place them around your home.
Strategy 5 – Try Ultrasonic Mouse Repellers
If effective, this is one of the simplest and most humane ways to rid your home of mice. These devices plug into an outlet and supposedly produce a high-frequency sound that isn’t supposed to bother pets yet repels rodents.
The jury is still out on how effective they are. Some people swear by them, while others say they are complete junk. Typically, ultrasonic mouse repellers don’t work through walls, so you may need one unit for each room; large rooms might need multiple devices. They do consume a bit of electricity, but it does seem worthwhile if they are effective.
Hopefully, these strategies will get you well on your way to a mouse-free home. Often, it is necessary to use a few of these approaches to completely solve an existing problem. Yet, applying the first two strategies might be enough to prevent a mouse infestation from developing.

"Good, Better, Best: The Climate Impacts of Milks","Milk may do a body good, but it’s not so kind to the planet. Milk’s ethical and environmental drawbacks have led many people to look for alternatives. And although plant-based milk alternatives are not the only factors, dairy milk sales dropped 13% during the Twenty-teens. Since 1975, the amount of milk consumed by the average American has fallen from 1-1/4 cups to just two-thirds of a cup.
The dozens of milk alternatives available make cutting out dairy easy. But each alternative has its own nutritional, ethical, and environmental profile that makes choosing among them anything but straightforward.
To help you make informed shopping decisions, we rank the greenhouse gas emissions of five of the most popular alternatives to plain-old cow’s milk and explore their overall environmental impacts.
Good – Organic Dairy
For many people – especially the nonallergic, lactose-tolerant who are not ready to go vegan – the nutritional benefits of dairy milk are too great to pass up. Whole milk is a good source of vitamin B12 and calcium and provides up to 9 grams of protein per cup – more than any milk alternative.
Unfortunately, conventional dairy production is so intensive that if you take milk in your coffee, most of the climate impact — 32 grams out of 53 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) for your morning drink — comes from the milk. Producing a glass of dairy milk generates around 0.6 kilograms of greenhouse gases and uses around 1,050 liters of water. Let’s put that in perspective, your 12-ounce glass of milk takes 2,958 times as much water to produce as you drink in one cup.
A 2019 European study found the climate impact per kilogram of milk was only slightly lower for organic milk. But organic milk was clearly better in terms of resource use, biodiversity, and ecotoxicity. Horizon Organic, Alexandre Family Farm, and otherw sare pursuing regenerative agriculture practices that will make milk carbon positive. Look for Regenerative Organic Certified dairy brands to support this important movement.
Better – Rice and Soy
Rice milk has the highest environmental impact of plant-based milks, but still produces only a third of the greenhouse gases per liter that dairy milk does.
Compared to cow milk’s 3.2 kilograms of CO2-eq per liter, rice milk produces only 1.2 kg. of CO2 per liter; soy milk performs a bit better with 1.0 kg. per liter. The land use impact of these two is almost negligible in comparison to dairy. Even the relatively high use of water to produce rice milk – 270 liters of water per liter of milk – is less than half that of dairy.
In addition to lower greenhouse gases, soy milk also has the lowest water use of the five kinds of milk surveyed. This makes it perhaps the best overall choice when all environmental impacts are considered, especially if you can source milk made from organic beans grown in the U.S. or Canada. (If you are concerned about the fact that so much soy is genetically modified, an industry-funded study found non-GMO pea milk to have similar benefits and impacts to soy.)
Best – Oat and Almond
Oat milk was The Guardian’s pick for most overall sustainable plant-based milk. Oat milk comes in just ahead of soy with 0.9 kilograms of CO2 emissions per liter. But its land-use impacts are slightly higher, and it uses significantly more water. The Oatly brand, which does not use the herbicide Roundup and has made numerous sustainability efforts in its operations, estimates their climate impact at only 0.34 kg./liter – significantly lower than the average emissions for this milk type.
From a carbon standpoint, almond milk is the winner with only 0.7 kg. of CO2 emissions per liter. It is second only to rice milk in minimizing land use impacts. But almond milk is by far the most water-intensive of any plant-based milk — it uses 371 liters of water to produce one liter of milk. That’s a little more than half as much as dairy milk. In addition, nearly all almonds are grown in water-scarce climates, which makes their high water use even more damaging.
Making a Choice
The most definitive milk environmental impact data available comes from an Oxford study that looked at five kinds of milk: cow, rice, soy, oat, and almond and averaged huge amounts of data. For each milk type, regional agricultural methods and even different brands’ processing methods will affect the actual environmental impact of individual products.
Source: Datawrapper
And there is no scientific method for weighting CO2 emissions against other environmental impacts.
There is no clear winner among milk choices. But environmentalists can relax in knowing that any nondairy milk is significantly less impactful than cow’s milk. This is true for greenhouse gas emissions and across all other measured impacts.
So whether you choose the milk alternative that is good, better, or best for the climate or make your choice based on other environmental factors or nutrition and flavor, your non-dairy milk of choice is a good one.

10 Weird Things You Can Actually Compost,"Composting is a magic process where kitchen waste transforms into rich, black soil. Even those of you without one of these magical boxes in the backyard probably know that you can compost fruit and veggie peels, coffee grounds, and paper towels — but how about hair? Or clothing?
Clearly Compost
Read on for a list of the weirdest things you can pop in your backyard compost bin to become black gold.
1. 100% Cotton Balls and Q-tips
One of the strangest things I encountered when I recently took my zero-waste adventure was suddenly looking at everything in my life in a new light. I’d long ago switched out my cotton balls for washcloths, but I’d never thought about whether I could compost Q-tips — you can! One hundred percent cotton and cardboard Q-tips and cotton balls can be tossed into your compost bin and will get broken down by microorganisms and bacteria just like everything else.
Note: If your Q-tips have plastic stems, they don’t belong in the compost.
2. Dryer Lint From Natural Fiber Clothing
As soon as it’s even mildly warm outside, you’ll find me rushing outside with a basket full of wet laundry to hang on the clothesline. I like how meditative the process is, how fresh it makes my clothes smell, and I love the energy savings. I live in Canada, though, so there are many months where line-drying clothes would mean making T-shirt popsicles. Enter the dryer and its byproduct — dryer lint. To prevent fires, it’s always a good idea to clean out dryer lint after every load. But if your clothing is made up of 100% natural fibers (like organic cotton, linen, wool, and silk), you can collect it in a jar or a bowl and add it to your compost pile.
Note: Dryer lint is compostable only if all of the material you are drying is made of 100% natural fibers. Most clothing today contains synthetic fibers that are not compostable and actually pollute the environment. So before you start chucking dryer lint into the pile, make sure you’ve dried only items with natural fibers.
3. Coffee Grounds and Paper Filters
After brewing your morning cup, don’t throw out those grounds! Used coffee grounds and even paper coffee filters make a great addition to your compost pile; doing so is a great way to reduce waste. If you’re not a coffee drinker but you still want to be part of the movement to rescue coffee grounds from an untimely end, stop by your local coffee shop. Many coffee shops have started giving away used coffee grounds to avid composters just like you.
4. Fur and Hair
If you’re skilled (or broke) enough to do home haircuts, stop throwing the clippings into the trash! You can add hair, and fur, to compost piles instead. The material biodegrades quite quickly, and although pet hair and hair clippings probably don’t make up a huge portion of your weekly garbage bag, every little bit counts. Plus, any more incentive to get your hair done is a good one in my books!
5. Stale Food
When we think about composting, we typically think about fruit peels, veggie trimmings, and the limp lettuce at the back of the crisper. But your compost bin can also help you get rid of stale bread and crackers, expired spices, and plain rice or pasta. Next time you clean out your pantry, take a good look at what you’re throwing out! There’s a great chance that it could be composted, instead.
6. Paper and Cardboard
Paper and cardboard can also be sent to the compost pile to be broken down. Image Credit: yaasa / Shutterstock
There’s really nothing weird about composting phone bills or cereal boxes. But I have always recycled paper and cardboard, rather than composting them. Call it a habit acquired from the many years of working in an office and not having a compost bin at home. But composting can also be a good choice for these items. Next time you need some additional brown materials to balance out the green materials in your bin, newspaper, plain paper, and cardboard can do the trick.
Bonus: For those concerned with identity theft, you know no one’s going to go digging through your compost bin.
7. Clothing
Shopping secondhand means that my clothes are always a little worn when I get them and then I wear them out completely, so by the time I’m done with a pair of jeans or a shirt, there’s no chance of anyone else wanting them, either. I sometimes cut old sheets or T-shirts into rags, but I’ve always struggled with what to do with clothing that’s too old or stained to wear. Apparently, I could have been composting it! Clothing made from 100% natural fibers like cotton, wool, or silk can be put into your compost bin to biodegrade. (Remove buttons, zippers, snaps, and other non-compostables first.) Clothing can be quite bulky, so I’d use this option sparingly.
8. Natural Wine Corks
If you’d really like to hide the evidence of how much you love the vino, recycle (or reuse) the bottles and then throw the natural corks into the compost bin. The natural cork will biodegrade and no one will be the wiser.
Bonus: If you’re crafty, check out these wine cork crafts before sending the corks to rot.
9. Vacuum Debris
As long as there aren’t large pieces of non-compostable material in your vacuum debris (such as bits of plastic, twist ties, beads, and so forth), you can just add the contents of your vacuum cleaner bag or canister to your compost. Most household debris is made up of dust, dry skin, and hair — all readily biodegradable in your bin. If your vacuum cleaner bag is made from 100% paper, you can compost it, too. But beware, most of today’s HEPA vacuum cleaner bags are made from plastics like polypropylene, and you don’t want that in your compost.
10. White glue and masking tape
As the mom of a prolifically creative preschooler, it made me unreasonably happy to discover that white glue and masking tape didn’t mean that a piece of paper was necessarily destined for the trash. Arts and crafts are rarely recyclable, but when you use white glue and paper materials (or even 100% cotton balls), you can add a little culture to your compost pile by composting artwork.

Recycling Mystery: Can You Recycle Underwear?,"When it comes to greening your wardrobe, a lot depends on what you do with your clothing at the end of its usefulness to you. We urge you to never send clothing to the landfill. Textile recycling is alive and well in the United States. Almost always, nonprofits that accept donations of clothing will recycle articles that are not reusable.
Underwear is sometimes an exception with clothing donations, for obvious sanitary reasons. And with all textiles, there are grades: Is the undergarment reusable or is it worn out? Sometimes underwear is still in very good shape and should find a new user. This is especially true for kids’ underthings that they grow out of quickly.
Nonprofits That Accept Underwear
Many nonprofits use donations of clothing and housewares to fund their mission while providing clothing to those in need either at low or no cost. Some of these include USAgain, Easter Seals, and the Salvation Army. Others such as PlanetAid provide usable clothing to sellers in other countries to distribute in their stores.
All of these groups state that they will send unusable clothing for recycling. The textiles can be shredded and made into soundproofing for appliances, wiping rags, rug pads, commercial insulation, and more.
Those listed above are all large, national nonprofits. You may have a homeless or transition shelter in your town that is looking for clothing. They need underwear. Call or email to ask if they accept gently used undies.
More Underwear Recycling Options
If you are buying new underwear, you might turn to a few forward-thinking underwear companies that accept used underwear for recycling. Subset, formerly known as Knickey, will trade you a pair of free organic underwear when you recycle underwear (any brand) through them. Hanky Panky, a lingerie company, also accepts bras and panties of any brand for recycling with a purchase. Additionally, clothing retailers H&M and Zara accept clothing of all brands for recycling.
You might have some luck finding a textile recycling group in your area in the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association database. Also, check out Earth911 Recycling Search for locations near you that accept “clothing” or “fabric” — be sure to call to confirm the organization accepts used underwear.
There are a few businesses, such as Simple Recycling and Ridwell, that will pick up clothing for recycling in some areas. But if you have a great deal of textile recycling along with your underwear, you might want to turn to TerraCycle, a company that believes everything can be recycled and makes it happen. You can purchase Retold Bags, Trashie Take Back Bag or TerraCycle Fabrics and Clothing Zero Waste Box to fill and return to the companies for processing, and sometimes, store credits. A caveat: These valuable service doesn’t come cheaply, but works well if you pool resources with others. You can also check for TerraCycle’s free clothing recycling programs; these change periodically and are usually limited to certain clothing types and brands.
Bra Recycling and Donation
You have a few more options for direct donation and recycling your bras than you do for other undies. The Bra Recycling Agency (B. R. A.) accepts worn-out and unusable bras for recycling.
A couple of nonprofits provide bras to girls and women in unfortunate situations. Send your still-usable bras to I Support the Girls and Bras for Cause.
Still More Options for Your Undies
If you’re more of a DIY recycler, there are even more options for your underwear. Consider upcycling your underwear fabric; if it’s a cute pattern, turn your undies into an accessory or patch.
If your underwear is 100% cotton, you might try cutting it into strips and seeing what happens in your backyard compost pile.
As a last resort, you can always extend the life of your undies by using them as cleaning rags.

How To Recycle Inhalers,"If you need an inhaler, the chances are good you think about that little device pretty often — making sure you have it when you head to the gym or out in nature, making sure you have a replacement canister when the number of remaining puffs gets low. And if you’re an environmentalist, you might think about how to properly dispose of the box of empties in your garage.
The well-known metered-dose inhalers rely on propellants. Until the Montreal Protocol, those propellants were chlorofluorocarbons. CFCs have long since been replaced by hydrofluoroalkanes, which are still greenhouse gases but are far less damaging than CFCs.
The dry powder inhaler and soft mist inhaler types are greener choices, but only if they are appropriate for your condition. Ten Americans die every day from asthma. Inhalers are literally lifesaving devices. Their use is not optional and no one should switch medications without their doctor’s approval.
That makes the question of proper inhaler disposal even more important. Some inhalers may come with disposal instructions, but most of us do not know what to do with our empty and expired inhalers. Can we recycle inhalers?
The Inhaler Canisters
Inhaler canisters are pressurized, so must not be disposed of in the recycling bin or the garbage because they can cause worker injuries, damage equipment, and the contents contribute to global warming if not handled properly. In many communities, taking inhalers to a hazardous waste facility is the only, and safest, course of action.
In the United Kingdom, a new nationwide inhaler canisters recycling program was announced in late 2023. Inhalers can be returned to a pharmacy, where they will either be treated as medical waste after the greenhouse gases are destroyed.
Unfortunately, the question is trickier in the United States, where there is no national or federally sponsored disposal or recycling program. However, most Walgreens, Safeway, and CVS do accept inhalers through their in-pharmacy disposal programs — look for a kiosk near the pharmacy section of these stores when visiting to drop off canisters. Some Kaiser Permanente pharmacies offer drop-off programs for inhalers and other medicines, EpiPens, and sharps.
Because they are made from metal, inhaler canisters are technically recyclable, but they require special handling. In most cases, municipal programs will not accept inhalers because of the risks involved in processing them, but contact your recycling provider to see if they accept inhaler canisters before searching for other options.
The Plastic Dispenser
Because they are not under pressure and do not contain medicine, plastic dispensers that fit on inhaler canisters may be easier to recycle. Before you toss empty dispensers in your curbside bin, check with your local recycling program to see if they accept plastics.
Many municipal programs do not accept the polycarbonate type of plastic used in inhaler dispensers. But it is worth checking by calling your recycler or transfer station.
Safe Disposal
Medicine take-back and recycling programs are in constant flux in the U.S., and their rules can be confusing. But it’s always a good idea to call medicine take-back program drop-off sites in advance to confirm that they accept inhalers.
Some states, including Washington, Oregon, Nebraska, Maine, and Illinois, have publicly funded medicine take-back programs that may accept outdated or partially used inhalers. Because every state and locality has its own rules, our best advice is to assume canisters are generally not accepted and the dispenser may be recycled if your local program accepts polycarbonate plastics, although few do.

"Good, Better, Best: Shopping for Natural Fibers","The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of annual global carbon emissions. That means it is a productive target for personal changes that can make a significant contribution to lowering overall human carbon emissions.
You can use thredUP’s fashion footprint calculator to estimate your personal fashion footprint. When you must buy new clothes, you can look for sustainable clothing brands. But these can be expensive and tend to have limited options. Since fabric production accounts for roughly 59% of a garment’s climate impact, paying attention to which fabrics you buy could help you minimize the impact of your wardrobe refresh.
In general, natural fibers tend to use less energy than synthetics, which indicates a lower climate impact. But natural fibers are often more damaging in terms of immediate environmental impacts such as land use, water consumption, and ecotoxicity from chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and dyes.
Good
Cotton
Cotton is the largest non-food crop in the world, and unfortunately, its immediate environmental impacts are severe. Growing cotton consumes and pollutes vast quantities of water, degrades soil, and generates chemical pollution that harms workers and habitats. But these impacts and greenhouse gas emissions can vary widely depending on where and how the plant was grown.



Cotton Type
Kg of CO2 emissions per ton of spun fiber


Conventional cotton (USA)
5.9


Organic cotton (USA)
2.35


Organic cotton (India)
3.8



Data: Carbon Footprint of Textile and Clothing Products




But cutting cotton from one’s closet would be a challenge. To do some good, pay the cost premium for domestically produced organic cotton.
Silk
Silk is a protein-based fabric, made from the cocoons of Bombyx mori, which is killed in the process of extracting the filament. Sericulture (silk farming) usually occurs in countries where obtaining reliable data is challenging and worker conditions are uncertain. Invasive in America, the mulberry tree is a low-impact crop in Asia that requires few chemical inputs.
The Higg Materials Sustainability Index ranks silk’s impacts higher than most fibers due to fossil fuel use during processing. However, at least one study indicates that carbon sequestration on mulberry plantations may make silk production carbon positive.
If you’re going to spend the money on silk, it’s good to look for the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) label. Wild silk (aka Peace or Ahimsa silk) is lower quality and can be hard to find but does not require boiling the larvae.
Wool
Wool is a protein-based fiber, usually sourced from sheep, but sometimes from goats, alpacas, camels, and even rabbits. Although wool fibers can be collected without killing the animal, there are still animal welfare considerations – these are particularly well-documented for mohair goats.
One study estimated that a kilogram of fine-grade wool generates from 7.83 to 18.70 kilograms of CO2 equivalent (click to download a PDF file). That’s a much higher climate impact than cotton. But the production of wool garments does not require large amounts of chemicals or dyes, and the resulting yarn is easily recycled and biodegradable.
Especially if you’re avoiding synthetic fabrics, you may find some wool clothing necessary. In that case, it’s good to look for certified wool. The Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) is one prominent wool certification group; Woolmark and the International Wool Textile Organization (IWTO) are two others.
Better
Cellulosic Fibers
Rayon (aka viscose) is made by extracting cellulose from wood using solvents, which makes this a hybrid material that combines natural and synthetic features. The primary solvent used to make rayon, carbon disulfide, is highly toxic. Manufacturers rarely recycle it and often release it into the environment, although better production methods are catching on. Some rayon might be made from illegally logged wood. Due to its complex manufacturing practice, in a qualitative comparison between common textiles, rayon ranked the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any “natural” fiber.
Image source
Despite potentially higher carbon emissions, rayon has lower impacts from land use, dyeing, and finishing processes than cotton. Particularly Tencel rayon, made from certified wood with recycled solvent, can be a better choice than cotton or protein-based fabrics.
Bast Fibers (Hemp, Linen, Jute)
Bast fibers are made from the stems of plants like hemp, jute, or flax (which makes linen). In general, these plants require little water and fertilizer to grow. No part of the hemp plant is wasted, and hemp fibers have even been shown to have antibacterial properties. Although bast fibers are not without environmental impacts – especially in the chemicals used for processing, organic hemp and organic flax are among the most sustainable fibers according to the Made-By Environmental Benchmark for Fibers. Even when they’re not organic, bast fibers are a better textile choice.
 Best
What is the best natural fiber for the environment? Every material comes with an environmental impact. New kelp-based materials, such as Keel Labs‘ Kelsun, which was featured in designer Stella McCartney’s Spring 2024 collection, represent a promising direction.
The fashion industry involves convoluted supply chains and opaque industrial practices. As a result, the life cycle analysis of various textiles is incomplete and inconsistent. Emerging textiles like bamboo might be more sustainable, but there simply isn’t enough data to know yet.
In the absence of truly sustainable options, buy the clothes that work best for you and wear them out. When shopping for natural fibers, look for organic and untreated options. Before you shop, apply strategies for reducing your consumer carbon footprint to your closet. Because regardless of your fabric choice, buying less is the best choice.

Recycling Mystery: Old Kitchen Glassware,"You may have heard the phrase, “glass is infinitely recyclable.” So why isn’t kitchen glassware — drinking glasses, glass dishes, and glass bakeware — accepted by your local recycler?
Various additives are used in the manufacture of kitchen glassware, which makes it much more difficult to recycle than common container glass. In fact, it’s so challenging that you’re unlikely to find a recycler that accepts it. Made from sand, glass is in greater demand than ever, growing at six percent a year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Nevertheless amidst a growing sand shortage, glass collected by recycling programs has often been ground into a sand-like material for use as daily cover in landfills, replacing soil instead of being melted down for new products and packaging.
Different Types of Glass
In your home, you have primarily two types of glass, soda-lime glass and borosilicate glass.

Soda-lime glass is used in everything from jars to windows. It’s the most common type of glass produced.
Borosilicate glass is a type of glass that is able to heat and cool rapidly without breaking. It has many applications, but for home use you’re probably most familiar with it as bakeware, such as the old Pyrex baking dish your mom used to use.

When it comes to recycling glass, most U.S. recycling programs accept soda-lime glass — within limits. They typically accept what’s called container glass, such as glass soda and beer bottles, wine bottles, and other glass food containers you see at the grocery store.
And while we’re talking about types of glass, colored glass is also a consideration. Recyclers will often accept several different colors of glass, but not all the colors you may buy. Glass manufacturers use a number of materials to create colored glass. If different colors of glass get recycled together, it diminishes the quality of the recycled product and loses its market value. So, separating the differently colored glass prior to recycling is an extra, expensive step for recyclers.
Reuse Before Recycle
Before we jump to recycling, it’s important to note that if your glassware is in perfect condition, please don’t recycle it or throw it away. Give it to someone who could use it. Most donation centers accept clean, unbroken glass cups and dishes. If you have a complete set of cups or bakeware, you may even be able to sell it on Craigslist or at a local consignment store.
Can You Recycle Glass Cups or Bakeware?
The short answer to this question: Not likely. Check with your local recycling program to find out if they have a program in place for kitchen glassware. Add your ZIP Code to this Earth911 Recycling Search for help finding glassware recyclers in your area.
While your glass cups and wine glasses are likely made from soda-lime glass, they aren’t recyclable in most places. This is because manufacturers use additives to adjust the glass for its intended purpose. You’ve probably noticed that wine glasses break more easily than a soda bottle or a pickle jar. This is because the composition of the glass is slightly different. Additives change the melting point of the glass. Container glass, as well as glass used in food jars and beverage bottles, share a common melting point, making it easy to recycle together. This is why recycling programs commonly accept only container glass.
Glass bakeware is manufactured to have a higher melting point. Although older glass bakeware used to be made of borosilicate glass — and much European bakeware still is — most U.S.-manufactured glass bakeware is now made of tempered soda-lime-silica glass. But no matter what your glass bakeware is made of, if it’s mixed in with container glass, it will contaminate the entire recycling batch since it won’t melt at the same temperature.
For this reason, glass bakeware can’t be recycled with container glass. Because the lifespan of most glass dishes is so long and the volume of bakeware made from this type of glass is so low, it isn’t possible for companies to make money recycling it, so there aren’t really recycling programs out there.
Broken glass is not accepted for recycling even if it’s container glass, as it presents a hazard for workers who collect your waste. Wrap it carefully before disposing in the trash. Image: Adobe Stock
How to Dispose of Broken Glassware
Even if it’s recyclable container-type glass, don’t put any broken glass in your recycling bin. Broken glass is a hazard to workers who collect and sort your recyclables. So, the only option is to throw it away. Since it’s also a hazard to trash collectors, here’s the best way to handle it:

Wrap up the broken glass in newspaper or cloth and place it inside a small cardboard box. Pour any other small broken glass inside the box.
Stuff any additional newspaper into the box so the glass can’t bounce around as easily.
Tape the box closed securely and write “Broken Glass” on the outside.
Throw the box into the trash bin.

One last thing, while this article focuses on kitchen glassware, please note that windows and glass doors typically cannot be recycled in your city recycling bin either. Because most windows contain plastic layers between sheets of glass, they are often not accepted for recycling. If they are still in working condition, the Habitat for Humanity ReStore may accept them, but do call first to confirm. If you can’t find anyone interested in reusing them, please dispose of them carefully in the trash.

How To Create a Rain Garden,"In natural landscapes, rainwater and snowmelt filter down into the ground slowly. This slow infiltration recharges groundwater and filters out contaminants, promoting water quality. A rain garden in your yard can capture and keep vital moisture available for your plants and the local aquifer.
In many built areas, pavement, roofs, gutters, compacted soils, and storm drains disrupt groundwater recharge. Instead of moisture percolating down into the ground, stormwater systems funnel it through stormwater systems into waterways. Unfortunately, fertilizers, oil, chemicals, and bacteria are washed away as well, contaminating this precious resource and funneling it away.
A delightful way to bring the water functionality of natural landscapes into our yards and gardens is by creating a rain garden. These lovely creations utilize runoff from roofs and yards and channel them into a small depression in the yard. Wildlife thrives with water, thus adding a rain garden is rewarding, even if it is a small area.
A common misconception about rain gardens is that they commonly have standing water. In ideal conditions, water pools for only several hours before percolating down. Adding a rain garden involves rerouting the downspouts or runoff into a depression in the yard where it can filter down. This requires some advanced planning and is a fun weekend project.
Observe and Measure
Get started by observing how water flows across your yard, roof, and driveway during heavy rainfall. How much water do you have to manage and where does it pool? Topography, soil composition, vegetation, and impervious surfaces affect the water flow across the landscape. Explore how rerouting gutters, downspouts, and driveway runoff will impact the movement and accumulation of water.
Then, it is time to crunch some numbers. Use the Rain Garden Alliance calculator to estimate your rain garden’s ideal size and depth. It is essential to design the rain garden so it can handle the quantity of water it will receive.  If you notice that water already pools in an acceptable location, try to work with the existing garden topography when you site your new garden. It might require expanding this area if it already gets saturated. Because water flows downhill, make sure the rain garden is located downhill from the water source. 
Beware of water accumulating around the foundation of your house, and be sure to redirect it to an ideal location that is at least 10 feet away from your house. This helps prevent basement flooding and mold issues.
Paved areas affect the water flow. Be sure to direct it away from your house.
Creating Contours
To make the rain garden, start with an existing depression in your yard, or create a new one with a shovel. Don’t just remove the topsoil, ensure that there is ample soil left to capture water. It’s essential to have sufficient soil in the rain garden basin as a medium for plant growth. Your rain garden will need at least 6 inches of soil for it to function correctly.
The way water percolates down into your new garden depends on your soil composition. If you have excessive amounts of sand in the soil, rainwater will drain into the ground too fast. Topsoil and compost are needed to correct this. Too much clay in your soil causes water to pool beyond what is desirable for your new rain garden. Adding two parts sand, one part compost, and one part topsoil is an excellent way to improve drainage.
Water Infiltration
The purpose of a rain garden is not to collect rainwater but rather to encourage it to filter down into the ground.
You can easily test how water percolates in the soil by digging a 12-inch deep hole and filling it with water. It should completely drain out of the hole within 24 hours. Since standing water also encourages mosquitos, which could take advantage of standing water for breeding, be careful to ensure there is sufficient drainage.
Preparing the Garden Bed
If the future rain garden site contains grass, remove it, and possibly save it to create a small berm to channel the water.
Select vegetation based on your location. Consider if your site is in the sun or shade when selecting plants. The Old Farmer’s Almanac has a list of plants for both sun and shade and lists if plants are native. Rain gardens commonly include wildflowers, ferns, shrubs, and even small trees. Water-tolerant native or edible vegetation is ideal for areas of the yard where water pools. Avoid introducing invasive species.
Place the most water-tolerant plants in the center or lowest point in the garden where water will collect the longest. Plant natives whenever possible, especially in the outer edges where plants need to be more drought tolerant to avoid supplemental irrigation.

Recycling Mystery: Metal Lids & Bottle Caps On Glass Containers,"When discarding plastic bottles, many recycling services now prefer you screw plastic tops on before dropping empties in the bin. What do you do with the metal lids on bottles and jars?
Recycling practices are not universal and requirements vary — including what to do with lids from glass jars and bottles. With glass, the rules are usually different. We pause to note that it is always wise to ask your recycling service provider for specific instructions. With that said, below are some answers you may encounter if you ask what to do with tops-on glass containers.

Remove metal lids from jelly, mustard, and other jars.
Remove aluminum twist-off tops from wine, olive oil, and sparkling water bottles.
If you’re inclined to press the ridged metal caps back on beer and soda bottles, don’t.

Mixed Recycling No-No’s
After dropping empty, lid- and cap-free glass containers into your recycling bin, what do you do with the metal caps and lids?
Metal is definitely recyclable. But lids and caps are often undesirable in mixed recycling — with some exceptions — because most equipment doesn’t efficiently sort and separate them.
During sorting, caps and lids often wind up with glass shards, explained Robert Pickens of the Oklahoma Recycling Association. When the glass is shipped off for processing, mixed in metal adds extra weight and may boost the transportation expense, he said. That added cost makes glass recycling unaffordable for many cities.
At the glass processing facility, depending on its equipment and practices, the metal might be collected for recycling. Or, it might simply be discarded.
Wide-mouth metal jar lids with a minimum diameter of 2 or 3 inches may be an exception, even if other metal lids are not accepted in mixed recycling, Pickens noted. Among the providers accepting 3-inch lids in mixed recycling, at least in some of its service areas, is Waste Management. Three-inch lids usually are able to sort properly with other metals, a Waste Management spokeswoman explains.
Metal Recyclers Usually Want Them
So, you separate your metal lids and caps — what to do with them? Metal recyclers typically accept — and may even pay for — lids and caps from the public.
“Metals are some of the more valuable materials in the recyclable stream,” said Kent Kiser, publisher of Scrap, a bimonthly magazine published by the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, which recently changed its name to the Remanufactured Materials Association.

For example, American Metal Recycling in Ohio pays for steel and aluminum drop-offs. The company welcomes metal lids and aluminum caps, explained supervisor Scott Hudack. He continued, “I think everything we do to save our environment is a step in the right direction.”
American Metal Recycling pays per pound of eligible material. Depending on the market, the payout is usually 5 cents to 9 cents for steel and about 35 cents to 45 cents for food-grade aluminum, according to Hudack.
A well-intentioned person who would need to drive a significant distance to drop off a small number of caps at a metal recycler might want to evaluate whether recycling the metal is worth the environmental impacts of a road trip.
What About the Coating Inside the Lid?
Today, most metal caps and lids have an inside coating where the metal would otherwise come into contact with the container’s contents. But this non-metal coating doesn’t necessarily mean that these items won’t be accepted by metal recyclers. Pickens said that coatings usually are not an issue, because they burn off when the metal is melted.
Sheldon Hoffman, owner of American Metal Recycling, said acceptability of a metal lid with a non-metal coating— such as rubber, plastic, or other material — would depend on the material, whether that material needed to be removed, and if removing that unwanted material would be worth the effort to reclaim the metal.
My Provider Can’t Take Loose Caps and Lids
If your recycling service doesn’t accept loose metal caps and lids in your curbside bin, ask your provider if this technique would be acceptable: Drop caps and lids into cans of matching metal (for example, steel lids into steel cans and aluminum caps into aluminum cans). That way, the small lids and caps will pass through the automated sorting process without dropping out prematurely.
To make jar-lid recycling work, you need to follow a few guidelines:

Don’t mix metals, which are usually differentiated by whether they’re magnetic. “It would not be acceptable to a metal processor to place an aluminum cap in a steel container … or the other way around,” Pickens recommended.
Don’t flatten cans or containers because automated sorting equipment usually identifies objects by weight and dimension, cautioned Pickens. A three-dimensional object needs to remain three-dimensional to be recognized for what it is and sorted properly.  Pinch just the top to hold the caps in the larger container.

If your curbside provider doesn’t accept metal lids and caps at all, your next bet is to find a nearby metal recycling facility.  And to avoid wasting a trip, call to confirm they’ll accept your items before you make the delivery.
Ideas for Repurposing
Some artists devise colorful mosaics using metal bottle caps, such as the following mahi-mahi masterpiece by Eric Henderson of Eric’s Easel.

Chelsea Odum, education and program coordinator for Resource Depot, a nonprofit creative reuse center in Florida, offered a few other crafty ideas. Decorate the inside of the lids or caps with paint, photos, or other embellishments. Drill a hole and hang them as ornaments. Glue on a pin-back and wear. Or glue onto a magnet and pop them on the refrigerator.
Odum also suggested making kid-friendly musical instruments. Caps offer a pleasant rattling sound. Or stretch rubber bands of different sizes and tensions around a lid for a guitar-like instrument for youngsters.
Speaking of art, assorted lids are perfect as a palette for squirting dabs of paint during an art project.

  Guest Opinion: How You Can Help Create A Healthier Ocean By Composting 
  Good, Better, Best: Seafood","When discarding plastic bottles, many recycling services now prefer you screw plastic tops on before dropping empties in the bin. What do you do with the metal lids on bottles and jars? Recycling practices are not universal and requirements vary — including what to do with lids from glass jars and bottles. With glass, the rules are usually different. We pause to note that it is always wise to ask your recycling service provider for specific instructions. With that said, below are some answers you may encounter if you ask what to do with tops-on glass containers. Remove metal lids from jelly, mustard, and other jars. Remove aluminum twist-off tops from wine, olive oil, and sparkling water bottles. If you’re inclined to press the ridged metal caps back on beer and soda bottles, don’t. Mixed Recycling No-No’s After dropping empty, lid- and cap-free glass containers into your recycling bin, what do you do with the metal caps and lids? Metal is definitely recyclable. But lids and caps are often undesirable in mixed recycling — with some exceptions — because most equipment doesn’t efficiently sort and separate them. During sorting, caps and lids often wind up with glass shards, explained Robert Pickens of the Oklahoma Recycling Association. When the glass is shipped off for processing, mixed in metal adds extra weight and may boost the transportation expense, he said. That added cost makes glass recycling unaffordable for many cities. At the glass processing facility, depending on its equipment and practices, the metal might be collected for recycling. Or, it might simply be discarded. Wide-mouth metal jar lids with a minimum diameter of 2 or 3 inches may be an exception, even if other metal lids are not accepted in mixed recycling, Pickens noted. Among the providers accepting 3-inch lids in mixed recycling, at least in some of its service areas, is Waste Management. Three-inch lids usually are able to sort properly with other metals, a Waste Management spokeswoman explains. Metal Recyclers Usually Want Them So, you separate your metal lids and caps — what to do with them? Metal recyclers typically accept — and may even pay for — lids and caps from the public. “Metals are some of the more valuable materials in the recyclable stream,” said Kent Kiser, publisher of Scrap, a bimonthly magazine published by the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, which recently changed its name to the Remanufactured Materials Association.

Guest Opinion: How You Can Help Create A Healthier Ocean By Composting,"Did you know about the direct connection between home composting and the health of our ocean? For many, the tremendous benefits to the ocean may not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think about composting, but whether you live on the coast or in the middle of the country, embracing nature’s way of recycling really does have a transformative effect in preserving our marine ecosystems.
The ocean is closer than you think, and it’s an exciting reality that improving its health starts on land, so let’s take a minute to dig deeper into the benefits of home composting and look at some simple steps we can all follow to turn the tide and ensure a brighter future for our oceans.
Healthy Soil = Healthy Seas
In the United States today, the USDA estimates that between 30 and 40 percent of the food supply goes to waste. Once in the landfill, this waste creates a powerful greenhouse gas called methane that is driving climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere. By diverting organic waste from landfills and preserving these vital nutrients through composting ourselves, we can reduce this potent emission and instead create healthy soil that captures and stores more carbon dioxide.
The soil, produced without any use of chemical-laden synthetic fertilizers that pollute our waterways, can then be used in places such as fields, parks, roadsides, or gardens at home, and being a natural resource rich in essential nutrients, it’s able to better absorb and filter any surface runoff water. This not only helps reduce the risk of flooding and erosion but also improves the quality of the local waterways by limiting the amount of stormwater runoff polluting our rivers, streams, and seas.
That’s why everyone at 11th Hour Racing passionately believes composting is a revolutionary act of ocean conservation. If we all roll up our sleeves, grab our compost bins, and join forces, we can make a positive impact felt for generations to come.

All You Need is Enthusiasm and a Bucket
Home composting requires minimal effort, equipment, or expense. You really don’t need to be an expert to get started. Here are five simple steps to follow as you embark on your composting adventure!
Choose the right bin: The all-important first step. Think of your compost bin more as an organic treasure trove. There’s a variety of options available to suit every space and preference. Whether you opt for a rotating bin to aid decomposition, a wood or plastic open pile system that invites wildlife, or a traditional tumbler with a lid for easy access, the choice is yours. You’ll find a pretty basic homemade pile in my backyard, but it does the job! No yard? No problem. Many companies will come and collect your waste for you, and I’ll explain further how this works below.
Learn what you can (and can’t) compost: No doubt this can be a daunting prospect initially, but this infographic is a helpful resource to save and follow. Waste from fruit and vegetables is a great place to start, while tea bags and coffee grounds also provide us with daily opportunities to dispose of materials. Meat, dairy, and cooking oils must be avoided, as is any pet waste.
Balance green and brown material: This can be a delicate dance as the ratio between green and brown material in your compost pile affects how it heats up, how it breaks down, and even the smell. It’s not an exact science, but a recommended ratio is three-part browns to one-part greens. If your pile isn’t heating up, try adding more green material (grass clippings, fruit and veg scraps), and if it’s starting to smell, try adding more browns (leaves, twigs, sawdust).
Embrace living organisms: The unsung heroes of the compost pile. Worms, pill bugs, and other tiny critters play a vital role in the composting process by feasting on the organic matter and breaking it down. So, don’t be alarmed if you spot a wriggling worm or a scuttling pill bug in your pile – they’re doing an amazing job in front of your eyes!
Be patient: It’s essential to set realistic expectations. Composting is a natural process, and like all things in nature, it takes time. Don’t be discouraged if your compost pile doesn’t transform overnight. I certainly don’t do it perfectly, but Mother Nature is pretty forgiving, and with a bit of patience and enthusiasm, you’ll soon be rewarded with nutrient-rich compost.
What if I need extra support?
There’s a passionate community of compost leaders out there who can help support you on your journey whether that be through answering your questions, collecting your waste from your front door, or inspiring you with their initiatives and content. We know
this to be true first-hand as 11th Hour Racing supports projects that advance sustainable practices and directly impact ocean health. In 2023, our grantees helped divert 3,280,900 pounds of food waste from landfills via composting. You can find more than 80 composting collection services in the Northeast United States at 11thHourRacing.org or a map of national composting initiatives can be found here.

Using and Recycling CO2 Canisters from Home Soda Machines: What You Need to Know,"Readers have asked many times about the sustainability of home soda dispensers. More households are choosing soda machines to reduce plastic bottle use, and Consumer Reports found these systems more than pay for themselves in savings after about two years. But are the CO2 gas and canisters sustainable?
As we all know, CO2 is the gas warming the atmosphere — there is 50% more of it than before the Industrial Revolution, which has heated the planet by 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit, according to NASA. 
The CO2 used in these canisters is often derived from industrial sources, such as the by-products of ammonia or natural gas production. This means that while the CO2 is not directly released into the atmosphere, it is still a by-product of fossil fuel consumption. We borrow the CO2 for the bubbles in our soda, and the body expells it by breathing — it is not a significant source of global warming.  
Companies like SodaStream do not explicitly detail the carbon footprint of their CO2, but it is clear that the gas comes from industrial sources.
Canister Circularity
The question of how to responsibly recycle CO2 canisters is becoming increasingly relevant, as more than $800 million worth of machines and canisters are sold annually.
Most CO2 canisters for home soda machines are made from aluminum, a highly recyclable material. However, recycling these canisters isn’t as straightforward as tossing them in your curbside recycling bin. Because they are pressurized, CO2 canisters pose safety risks in the recycling process. They can rupture and potentially damage sorting equipment, which also creates hazards for recycling facility workers. Consequently, you won’t find local curbside programs accepting these pressurized items.
Finding a local drop-off option for recycling CO2 canisters can also be challenging. The risk of canisters bursting when crushed is significant, which is why many recycling centers are hesitant to accept them. Before attempting to drop off canisters, it’s crucial to contact local facilities to confirm whether they can safely handle them.
Manufacturer Exchange Programs: A Sustainable Alternative
The good news is that many CO2 canister manufacturers recognize these challenges and offer exchange programs. These programs are not only safer but also more sustainable. Reusing canisters is typically less resource-intensive than producing new ones from scratch. Here are some exchange programs offered by various brands:

SodaStream: Refill Program
Drinkmate: CO2 Exchange
SodaSense: How the Exchange Works
SimpliSoda: Home Page
Aarke: CO2 Loop
The Beverage People: Aarke CO2 Loop
Bubliq: CO2 Canister Info
Kül: CO2 Refill Pack

Many retail outlets, including CVS, Target, True Value, and Best Buy, also offer local exchange services. However, we recommend calling ahead to ensure the store participates in the exchange program.
While no canister makers are currently known to use naturally sourced CO2, you may want to ask your CO2 provider. This inquiry not only promotes transparency but also encourages companies to consider more sustainable practices.
If you have questions or find out more about your canister refill company’s CO2 sources, please let us know. Your input helps us all make more informed and environmentally responsible choices.
Reader Ideas
Bob writes from Poway, California, that he has success refilling his own CO2 containers: “I drive to my local CO2 wholesaler in my solar-charged EV and pick up a few pounds of dry ice pellets. Using a scale to ensure I don’t overfill the canisters, I pour in the appropriate weight of pellets, recap the canister, and close the vent. I’ve now minimized the environmental impact of having them shipped somewhere to be refilled and saved money. Granted, this isn’t for everyone to do, but done properly it’s a safe and straightforward process.”

Finding a local drop-off option for recycling CO2 canisters can also be challenging. The risk of canisters bursting when crushed is significant, which is why many recycling centers are hesitant to accept them. Before attempting to drop off canisters, it’s crucial to contact local facilities to confirm whether they can safely handle them. Manufacturer Exchange Programs: A Sustainable Alternative The good news is that many CO2 canister manufacturers recognize these challenges and offer exchange programs. These programs are not only safer but also more sustainable. Reusing canisters is typically less resource-intensive than producing new ones from scratch. Here are some exchange programs offered by various brands: SodaStream: Refill Program Drinkmate: CO2 Exchange SodaSense: How the Exchange Works SimpliSoda: Home Page Aarke: CO2 Loop The Beverage People: Aarke CO2 Loop Bubliq: CO2 Canister Info Kül: CO2 Refill Pack Many retail outlets, including CVS, Target, True Value, and Best Buy, also offer local exchange services. However, we recommend calling ahead to ensure the store participates in the exchange program. While no canister makers are currently known to use naturally sourced CO2, you may want to ask your CO2 provider. This inquiry not only promotes transparency but also encourages companies to consider more sustainable practices. If you have questions or find out more about your canister refill company’s CO2 sources, please let us know. Your input helps us all make more informed and environmentally responsible choices. Reader Ideas Bob writes from Poway, California, that he has success refilling his own CO2 containers: “I drive to my local CO2 wholesaler in my solar-charged EV and pick up a few pounds of dry ice pellets. Using a scale to ensure I don’t overfill the canisters, I pour in the appropriate weight of pellets, recap the canister, and close the vent. I’ve now minimized the environmental impact of having them shipped somewhere to be refilled and saved money. Granted, this isn’t for everyone to do, but done properly it’s a safe and straightforward process.” Post navigation Earth911 Podcast: Consumer Reports’ Chris Harto On The Lifetime Cost Of Climate Change Best of Earth911 Podcast: Ben Vivari On Getting Started With ESG Investing","May 14, 2024",Earth911,https://earthnew.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AdobeStock_781081501-resized.jpg,https://earth911.com/how-to-recycle/using-and-recycling-co2-canisters-from-home-soda-machines-what-you-need-to-know/,17,eader ask mani time sustain home soda dispens ore household choos soda machin reduc plastic bottl use andonsumereport foundthes system pay save two year ut ga canist sustain know ga warm atmospher itthan ndustrial evolut hasheat planet degre ahrenheit accord use canistersi often derivedfrom industri sourc thebyproduct ammonia natur ga productionhismean directli releasedinto atmospher still byproduct fossil fuel consumpt e borrow bubbl soda thebodi expel breath signific sourc global warm ompani like odatream explicitli detail carbon footprint iti clear ga come industri sourc anist ircular question respons recycl canist becom increasingli relev asmor millionworth machin canist sold annual ost canist home soda machinesar madefromaluminum highli recycl materialoweverrecycl canist isnt straightforward astoss curbsid recycl binecaus pressur canist pose safeti risk recycl process hey ruptur potenti damag sort equipmentwhich also createshazard recycl facil worker onsequ wont find local curbsid program accept pressur item ind local dropoff option recycl canist also challengingh risk canist burst crush significantwhich mani recycl center hesitantto accept themefor attempt drop canistersit crucial contact local facilitiesto confirm whether safe handl anufactur xchang rogram ustain ltern good news mani canist manufactur recogn challeng offer exchang program hese program safer also sustain eus canist typic less resourceintens produc new one scratch ere exchang program offer variou brand odatreamefil rogram rinkmat xchang odaenseow xchang ork impliodaom age ark oop everag eopleark oop ubliq anist nfo l efil ack retail outlet includ arget rue alu est uyalsooff local exchang servic owev recommend call ahead ensur store particip exchang program hile canist maker current known use natur sourc may want ask providerhi inquirynot promot transpar alsoencourag compani consid sustain practic f question find outmor canist refil compani sourc pleas let us knowour input help us make inform environment respons choic eader dea ob write oway alifornia success refil contain drive local wholesal solarcharg pick pound dri ice pellet sing scale ensur dont overfil canist pour appropri weight pellet recap canist close vent minim environment impact ship somewher refil save money rant isnt everyon done properli safe straightforward process ost navig arth odcast onsum eport hri arto n ifetim ost f limat hang est arth odcast en ivari n et tart ith nvest
How To Fight the Effects of Climate Change in Your Garden,"Climate change impacts everyone, there’s no escaping this global crisis. While change must come at the macro level, each of us can also make individual changes starting in our own backyards. Regenerative gardening is one way to improve our local resiliency and restore nature’s capacity to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Traditional gardening and lawn maintenance contribute to the climate crisis and regional water shortages. Between 15% and 30% of residential water consumption in the U.S. goes to water lawns and gardens, according to the EPA. We also send about 10.5 million tons of yard waste to landfills each year, which accounts for 7.2% of all municipal solid waste; it decomposes anaerobically and produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. And Americans apply roughly 59 million pounds of pesticides and herbicides to lawns and gardens annually that often end up in local water sources, according to a 2012 EPA report.
We can reduce our impact on the planet by employing regenerative agriculture practices in our gardens. Regenerative landscaping and gardening use natural methods to restore the water cycle, build healthy soil, and establish functional plant communities. The result is ecological resilience that helps protect against floods, droughts, and forest fires — and even captures carbon from the atmosphere. From water use to composting to natural pest control and beyond, the changes we make as individuals can have a beneficial impact on the planet. Here are a few ways to get started on creating a regenerative garden.
Water Cisterns and Rain Gardens
Slowing down water by capturing water in cisterns or infiltrating water into the ground through rain gardens, can help protect against flooding and droughts long-term. The water collected in cisterns can be used for irrigation — or with proper filtration or treatment even as drinking water.
Essentially puddles that grow plants, rain gardens capture and absorb overland water flow and runoff from impervious surfaces in your yard. They also relieve overwhelmed stormwater systems, helping to reduce nonpoint source pollution.
To build a rain garden, find a place away from your house where the water can overflow and run downhill; dig a basin at least 6 inches deep. Plant water-loving plants that can also withstand drought, such as bluestem grass, marsh hibiscus, and liatris.
Compost and Building Healthy Soil
Healthy soil can capture carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the ground. It can also absorb and retain water, which reduces runoff as well as the need for irrigation while increasing the garden’s resilience during the dry season.
Compost kitchen scraps and yard debris to add organic matter back into your yard. Keep your leaves and use them to cover planting beds. Recycle your cardboard as “sheet mulching” to establish a new bed, suppress weeds, and maintain soil moisture. Consider adding azomite soil supplements to increase the carbon capture capacity of your yard.
Native Plants and Plant Diversity
Try diversifying your plant selections to prevent disease and pest infestations. A wider variety of plant species can promote more resilient root systems that require less water. Plant diversity also supports pollinators, which have been decimated by herbicides, insecticides, and climate change.
Native plants specifically adapted to your bioregional climate can thrive with minimal care, reducing your dependence on chemical lawn supplements. If you don’t know where to start, we suggest working with locally-owned nurseries to source the right plants for your area.
Incorporate Edible Plants
In addition to eating locally grown food, consider raising your own greens and vegetables. Some call this approach “eating hyper-local.” When we focus on eating food that is grown nearby, we create relationships – with farmers, with local growers, and with the microclimates in our own garden. In addition to reducing your food’s transportation carbon footprint, you can also rebuild a relationship with the earth – one built on observation and reciprocity.
Nature-based solutions and resource-efficient, ecologically intelligent outdoor spaces do more than help alleviate the effects of climate change. They provide sustenance and joy, which we’ve seen for years through our regenerative landscaping work at Shades of Green Permaculture. Integrating human activity with natural surroundings is key to environmental health and our future on planet Earth.

How To Make Elegant DIY Test Tube Vases With Live Edge Stands,"Ditch the ordinary, embrace the extraordinary! Made with live-edge, natural wood and cradling delicate plants in glass, test tube vase terrariums bring a touch of magic to your space.
Forget boring planters and predictable pots – watch our video below to learn how to build your own stunning live-edge stands, showcasing nature’s beauty with modern design flair. Imagine single flowers suspended in glass, their roots like tiny works of art, held by a unique piece of handcrafted, organically shaped wood. These natural beauties elevate your home or office, adding a touch of elegance you can’t buy at the store. Ready to unleash your creativity and create like a pro? Let’s do it.
Watch our video tutorial and follow the directions below.

Finding Our Perfect Pieces
The adventure begins with choosing the wood for our test tube vase holders. The exciting part? There’s no one-size-fits-all answer! Use whatever speaks to you, unleashing your creativity to create a unique conversation piece.
We opted for live-edge wood, scouring the offcuts at a local sawmill. Remember, the key is finding pieces that complement your test tube size. For our 15cm vases, we chose wood chunks large enough to comfortably hold them without appearing comical or cramped.
So, ditch the ruler and embrace the freedom! Trust your eye and intuition, and you’ll discover the perfect wood companions for your project.
2 Test Tube Stand Designs to DIY
To maximize our trusty live-edge wood scraps, we crafted two distinct test tube vase stands. One design cleverly repurposes the cutout from the other as its base, embodying our “waste not want not” philosophy. Both showcase the natural beauty of the live edge while ensuring the test tubes remain the star of the show. Here’s a closer look at our creations…
Tools & Materials
This project is all about flexibility, so don’t worry about having every exact item! Here’s the general toolkit:

Drill press: Recommended for precise holes. If you don’t have one, a drill guide might help.
Forstner bits: Sizes depend on your test tube and wood thickness. We used 60mm and 22mm.
Hole saw: We used a 102mm (about 4 inches) hole saw, but any size suitable for your stand design works.
Drill bits: We used a 9.5mm (0.37 inches) bit for attaching the aluminum tube.
Aluminum tubing: Choose a diameter and length that fits your design. Ours was 9.7mm x 15cm (0.37 inches by 5.9 inches)
2-part epoxy: For adhering the tube to the stand.
Sandpaper (120 & 240 grit): Smooths the wood. Sanding with more grits is optional.
Finishing oil: We used Osmo oil, but choose any finish you like.

Adjust sizes and materials based on your specific design and preferences. Don’t stress about exact measurements or having every tool – be creative and have fun.
This guide outlines building two stunning test tube vase stands using live-edge wood. While the wood’s asymmetry adds a unique charm, it also presents some drilling challenges. We’ve developed two variations, using different types of wood.
Cedar Dream

Choose Your Canvas: Pick a live-edge piece that appeals to you visually and functionally. Look for a flatter side for the base and consider belt sanding for adjustments.
Centering the Hole: Ditch the measuring tape! Use your eye to position the hole saw, considering the wood’s natural shape. Drill carefully, starting with the larger hole saw and finishing with a hand drill for precision.
Test Tube Niche: Again, use your eye to center a smaller hole for the test tube to sit on the base created by the previous step. Refer to the video for visual guidance if needed.
Sanding Symphony: Belt sand both sides and the edges with 120 grit, preserving the live-edge character. Finish with a random orbit sander and hand sanding for details (240 grit).
Finishing Touch: Apply Osmo oil for a beautiful matte finish.

Fir Power

Shaping the Base: This piece benefits from a straight edge cut with a miter saw. Invert it for a unique base, and repurpose the leftover hole saw cutout from Design 1 and aluminum tubing for a stand extension.
Eye-Centered Drilling: Similar to Design 1, use your eye to center the hole, considering the wood’s shape. This time, use a 60mm Forstner bit due to the smaller working area. Secure the wood to a larger piece of plywood for stability while drilling.
Test Tube Haven: With the straight edge as a guide, measure and mark the center for the test tube hole. Drill through the top section so the tube rests on the Forstner bit base.
Sanding Finesse: Belt sand the front and back with 120 grit, but hand sand the more delicate live-edge circumference. Finish with a random orbit sander and hand sanding (240 grit) for the Forstner bit holes.
Osmo Magic: Apply Osmo oil for a stunning matte finish.

Clamp live-edge pieces securely when drilling. This is the trickiest and most dangerous step, so prioritize safety. Take your time! Enjoy the process and you’ll achieve a fantastic result. Always wear PPE!
Feel free to adjust sizes and materials based on your preferences. Embrace the asymmetry – it adds character! Refer to the video for detailed visual instructions.

Guest Opinion: Sidewalk Recycling Matters,"Residential recycling is vital to a greener life, but let’s talk about how to recycle when you’re out and about. While the amount of recyclables you deposit on the go is typically less than what you recycle at home, it makes a big difference to your environmental impact when running errands, walking in the city, on the beach, or attending events.
We founded Go Green Eco-Bins to make it easy for cities to introduce sidewalk recycling bins and pay for the collection and processing of the materials. Here’s why you should make the effort to recycle on the go.
Why Recycle On The Go
Environmental Impact: Picture a street littered with plastic bottles and food wrappers. Not a pleasant sight, right? Beyond aesthetics, this litter poses serious ecological threats. Recycling on the go helps reduce pollution, conserve resources, and protect wildlife habitats, including sea life. Every piece of trash properly disposed of makes a difference.
Community Health: Littered areas are more than unsightly; they can harm public health. Trash attracts pests and can become breeding grounds for bacteria, contributing to the spread of diseases. Recycling on the go can help keep our communities clean and safe.
Resource Conservation: Consider the materials we use daily—paper, plastic, aluminum. Recycling these items conserves natural resources and reduces energy consumption. When we recycle on the go, we ensure that valuable resources are diverted from landfills and reused, benefiting both the environment and future generations.
Economic Benefits: Recycling is good for the planet and the economy. It creates jobs in the recycling industry and can lead to cost savings for municipalities by reducing waste management expenses. Recycling on the go also contributes momentum to sustainable growth in your community—it sends an essential signal to city leaders that citizens care about a clean environment.
An eco bin in action. The program includes financial support for collection.
Personal Responsibility: We all are obligated to the planet and one another to minimize our environmental footprint. Recycling on the go is a simple yet powerful way to fulfill that responsibility.
Education and Awareness: Recycling on the go isn’t just about individual actions; it’s also about raising awareness in our communities. When others see us recycling in public spaces, it prompts them to think about their habits and the impact of their actions. By leading by example, we can inspire others to join the movement towards sustainability.
Long-term Sustainability: Ultimately, recycling on the go is about building a more sustainable future. Small changes to our behavior today can create a better world for future generations. Every bottle, can, and piece of paper recycled brings us one step closer to that future.
Recycling Challenges in Cities
Cities face challenges in recycling programs, especially since the “China ban” that made recycling less profitable after emerging economies stopped accepting heavily contaminated materials, like plastic bottles. Many cities only offer curbside recycling, leaving on-the-go recycling overlooked. With recycling bins in public places like parks and streets, people can avoid tossing recyclables in the trash.
However, while adding sidewalk recycling bins sounds good, someone has to pay for them, and these programs can be too costly for cities. Worse, they can be ineffective. If the bins are not labeled clearly, contamination rates will stay high, reducing the efficiency of local recycling processing.
Independent Solutions for On-the-Go Recycling
At Go Green Eco-Bins, we found a solution that pays for out-of-home recycling. We created a sponsored program, the Clean Streets Initiative, that tackles sidewalk recycling problems without costing cities a dime. Environmentally conscious sponsors support it and collaborate with local recycling groups to ensure proper recycling practices.
How can a program like this be free to cities? Green sponsors make it economically self-sustaining. Local businesses, such as realtors, restaurants, lawyers, and medical offices, adopt an eco-bin and display their messages on it. The sponsorship revenue pays to collect and process recyclables and non-recyclables, ensuring the eco-bins stay clean and well-maintained.
Clear Labels for Easy Understanding
The eco-bins use clear and standardized labels from Recycle Across America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to standardizing recycling labeling and simplifying the recycling process to reduce contamination rates.
These bins are made in the USA from durable and recyclable materials and use solar energy for illumination to ensure better visibility. The side panels of these Eco-Bins display important messages, including public service announcements, promoting community events, or a straightforward reminder to recycle.
Advertising supports free placement of eco bins in cities.
How Can You Support Sidewalk Recycling
As a citizen, you can make a difference every day. Use sidewalk recycling responsibly. Be mindful of the sidewalk recycling bins, use them for their intended purpose, and encourage others to do the same.
Read bin labels carefully: Check what materials are accepted because they vary by city and collection program.
Avoid wishcycling: Don’t throw non-recyclables into the recycling bin, hoping they might be recyclable. When in doubt, throw them out.
Education: Teach children from a young age what recycling is and how it is done correctly. Check Earth911 for guides to recycling hundreds of materials. Engage local schools in your efforts. Work with teachers to incorporate recycling education into the curriculum or organize recycling-themed events.
Organize community meetings: Host informal meetings or gatherings to discuss the importance of recycling and propose implementing sidewalk recycling in your neighborhood. Use these meetings to address concerns and gather support.
Advocate for recycling on social media: Share informative posts, infographics, and success stories to inspire and educate your community. You can create topics and groups about recycling on neighborhood apps like Nextdoor.
Lobby for change in your city: If on-the-go recycling isn’t available, advocate for these programs. Together, we can make a positive impact on our environment. Create a petition and collect signatures from community members who support the introduction of sidewalk recycling bins. Present the petition to local authorities or community leaders to demonstrate community interest and need.
Change often starts at the grassroots level, but that depends on you. By taking these steps and involving your community in the process, you can contribute to the adoption of sidewalk recycling in a meaningful way.

  Planting a Garden for the Birds 
  Earth911 Inspiration: We Need Wilderness","Residential recycling is vital to a greener life, but let’s talk about how to recycle when you’re out and about. While the amount of recyclables you deposit on the go is typically less than what you recycle at home, it makes a big difference to your environmental impact when running errands, walking in the city, on the beach, or attending events. We founded Go Green Eco-Bins to make it easy for cities to introduce sidewalk recycling bins and pay for the collection and processing of the materials. Here’s why you should make the effort to recycle on the go. Why Recycle On The Go Environmental Impact: Picture a street littered with plastic bottles and food wrappers. Not a pleasant sight, right? Beyond aesthetics, this litter poses serious ecological threats. Recycling on the go helps reduce pollution, conserve resources, and protect wildlife habitats, including sea life. Every piece of trash properly disposed of makes a difference. Community Health: Littered areas are more than unsightly; they can harm public health. Trash attracts pests and can become breeding grounds for bacteria, contributing to the spread of diseases. Recycling on the go can help keep our communities clean and safe. Resource Conservation: Consider the materials we use daily—paper, plastic, aluminum. Recycling these items conserves natural resources and reduces energy consumption. When we recycle on the go, we ensure that valuable resources are diverted from landfills and reused, benefiting both the environment and future generations. Economic Benefits: Recycling is good for the planet and the economy. It creates jobs in the recycling industry and can lead to cost savings for municipalities by reducing waste management expenses. Recycling on the go also contributes momentum to sustainable growth in your community—it sends an essential signal to city leaders that citizens care about a clean environment. An eco bin in action. The program includes financial support for collection. Personal Responsibility: We all are obligated to the planet and one another to minimize our environmental footprint. Recycling on the go is a simple yet powerful way to fulfill that responsibility. Education and Awareness: Recycling on the go isn’t just about individual actions; it’s also about raising awareness in our communities. When others see us recycling in public spaces, it prompts them to think about their habits and the impact of their actions. By leading by example, we can inspire others to join the movement towards sustainability. Long-term Sustainability: Ultimately, recycling on the go is about building a more sustainable future. Small changes to our behavior today can create a better world for future generations. Every bottle, can, and piece of paper recycled brings us one step closer to that future. Recycling Challenges in Cities Cities face challenges in recycling programs, especially since the “China ban” that made recycling less profitable after emerging economies stopped accepting heavily contaminated materials, like plastic bottles. Many cities only offer curbside recycling, leaving on-the-go recycling overlooked. With recycling bins in public places like parks and streets, people can avoid tossing recyclables in the trash. However, while adding sidewalk recycling bins sounds good, someone has to pay for them, and these programs can be too costly for cities. Worse, they can be ineffective. If the bins are not labeled clearly, contamination rates will stay high, reducing the efficiency of local recycling processing. Independent Solutions for On-the-Go Recycling At Go Green Eco-Bins, we found a solution that pays for out-of-home recycling. We created a sponsored program, the Clean Streets Initiative, that tackles sidewalk recycling problems without costing cities a dime. Environmentally conscious sponsors support it and collaborate with local recycling groups to ensure proper recycling practices.

What Is the Carbon Footprint of Video Streaming?,"Streaming a video is now a widespread activity for many of us. But, what are the carbon emissions associated with this activity? The Carbon Trust reported that the impacts are actually relatively minimal, especially compared to other activities.
In the Carbon Impact of Video Streaming, the authors explore the impact of one hour of video streaming. They found that powering a settop or mobile device was responsible for most of the carbon emissions. But the study didn’t explore the emissions from manufacturing the device or creating the streamed content. Two of the most significant variables are the location where the user streams the video and the electronic device they use.
Carbon Emissions From Electricity
The carbon emissions associated with a unit of energy varies by location depending on the efficiency of the power plants and the type of fuel used to generate electricity. Therefore, the power mix in your home varies depending on the power plants that provide energy. It also varies depending on the time of day, day of the week, and season. In addition, power plants are turned on and off depending on need and economic factors, so the energy mix varies depending on demand and other influences.
Coal, natural gas, and petroleum fuels contribute the lion’s share to carbon emissions from power plants and therefore have the most considerable impact on promoting climate change. Hydropower, solar, and wind energy are considered carbon-neutral, although there is still an environmental impact associated with these forms of power. However, there have been strides to improve these sources, such as developing recyclable wind turbine blades and manufacturing more efficient solar panels.
Some ways to reduce the carbon emissions associated with your power use are to promote energy efficiency around the home and use cleaner energy sources. If possible, install solar panels on your home. If this isn’t an option, many power companies have programs that allow customers to opt into renewable energy programs. Unfortunately, this often involves paying a slightly higher fee.
Another option is to join a community solar farm. Unfortunately, the laws vary across the United States, and only certain states have supportive policies. Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island are some of the leaders in community solar projects. To learn more about joining a community solar farm, search the EnergySage community solar database.
Energy-Efficient Video-Streaming Devices
The other big variable in the Carbon Trust study is the efficiency of the streaming device. For example, streaming a video on a 50-inch television consumes 4.5 times more energy than watching it on a laptop and 90 times more energy than watching it on a smartphone. Over time, devices are becoming more energy-efficient, which will help reduce carbon emissions associated with video streaming. So whenever possible, use the most energy-efficient device you can.
Other Communications Equipment
The Carbon Trust paper also explored aspects of video streaming in our homes and within the larger context. For example, streaming a video relies on equipment along the way to host videos and transmit the internet. Yet, despite all this other equipment, the user’s device still accounts for 54% of the total carbon footprint. Data centers come in a distant second place at 19%, according to the white paper.
Data centers are very energy-intensive operations and critical for internet traffic. The good news is that many IT giants are increasingly switching over to cleaner energy sources. So it is likely that data centers will continue to get cleaner in the future. As consumers, we can help encourage this by voicing a preference for clean energy and supporting companies that provide clear evidence of their sustainable practices.
We also rely on telecommunications equipment to tap into the internet, including everything our internet providers use before the internet enters our homes plus the routers and modems we use. As consumers, it’s hard to have much impact on the former, but we can use energy-efficient routers and even turn them off when not in use. To make this automatic, the JRS Eco router has a feature to turn off during scheduled intervals.
The Lowdown
Overall, Carbon Trust’s findings are that video streaming is a relatively low-carbon activity. However, it does provide some insights into how our individual actions can help reduce the overall emissions associated with streaming. The biggest opportunities are using more energy-efficient devices and cleaner energy sources.

Planting a Garden for the Birds,"Birds are the most welcome wildlife in the landscape garden. They are beautiful, musical, interesting to watch. Unlike deer and other large visitors that eat plants, birds can even protect your garden by eating harmful bugs. There are so many reasons to encourage birds to visit or even take up residence in your garden. Fortunately, welcoming birds to your yard is not hard. In fact, bird-friendly gardening often involves doing less work in the garden instead of more.

About Birdfeeders
Birdfeeders are the most obvious way to attract birds, and they can be very effective, especially for encouraging birds to spend time in spots that are convenient for birdwatching. But as anyone who has tried it knows, feeding the birds is a lot more complicated than just picking up a birdfeeder on a whim at the garden store.
Protecting your birdfeeder from squirrels and other critters is always a challenge. And filling the birdfeeder on a warm summer morning is a lot easier than trudging through the snow to fill it in midwinter — even though that’s when birds rely on our help the most. Many people don’t realize that bird feeders need more maintenance than just filling. An improperly maintained feeder can spread disease.
Planting for the Birds
Whether you keep the birdfeeder or not, there is another way to attract birds to your yard that doesn’t require you to battle squirrels and snow. You can plant a garden for the birds. With a little planning, your spring planting can provide natural, healthy food for birds year-round.
The most important characteristic of a bird-friendly garden is native plants. Depending on their species, birds may eat bugs, fruit, seeds, or nectar. While many horticultural varieties can attract insects and grow seeds, they won’t always match the specific nutritional needs of the birds that live in your area. Native plants have evolved alongside the birds and can provide all of these types of food in the way that works best for the birds. You can check with your local Audubon Society chapter or native plant society for advice on the best mix of regional plant varieties to support local bird populations. But a few native plants that work in most regions of the U.S. include coneflower, sunflowers, and milkweed. Don’t forget native trees — these can provide both food and shelter for your local birds.

Bird-Friendly Gardening
When you are landscaping for the birds, how you grow your garden is as important as what you grow. If you spray your garden with pesticides every time you see a bug, insect-eating birds will not find anything to eat in your yard. Pesticide residue on the plants could be toxic for fruit and seed-eating birds, too. You might have to adjust to a little more bug damage than you have been accustomed to tolerating. But who will notice a few chewed leaves when so many birds are hunting in your garden?
Along the same lines, birds do not have the same appreciation for a tidy garden that many humans do. If you skip the deadheading and leave leaf litter on the ground, the birds will have a lot more to eat; seedpods and overwintering bugs are perfect calorie-dense food sources for birds in the winter.
Avian Amenities
Birds don’t share our taste for neatness in the garden, but they do like a garden with multi-season interest. To make your garden appealing to the avian aesthetic, keep your plantings dense and multilayered with continuous blooming and a varied color palette. This provides cover and attracts a greater variety of tasty invertebrates and pollinators for seed production.
Bird-friendly garden design calls for certain amenities beyond plants. Birds need water just as much as mammals do. You can provide this with birdbaths or other water features, including ponds, reflecting pools, or even small puddles. A good mix of trees, a brush pile, and maybe even a snag will provide housing for a variety of species. But if your woody real estate is limited, consider installing some appropriately designed birdhouses.
It’s best to keep cats indoors, for their own safety and for the birds. Bell collars don’t actually make a difference to your cat’s ability to hunt birds. But if you can’t keep your cat indoors, you can reduce their predation somewhat through diet and exercise.
Get Bona Fide
You don’t have to replace your entire landscape to make your garden more bird-friendly. In fact, it makes a lot of sense to proceed slowly and observe which changes make the most difference. Books like Gardening for the Birds: How to Create a Bird-Friendly Backyard or regionally specific guides are helpful for deciding where to begin and how to proceed. The National Wildlife Federation’s Attracting Birds, Butterflies, and Other Backyard Wildlife is another helpful resource. And when you’ve made enough progress, they can also recognize your backyard as certified wildlife habitat.

Getting a Greener Clean: Shampoo,"It’s an unfortunate irony that the things we do to keep ourselves clean can pollute the planet and even harm our own health. It’s also discouraging that something as simple as a shower requires you to research multiple categories of cleaning product from shampoo to body wash. But let’s start at the top; you can adopt a green hair care routine without giving up your hygiene or your health.
No-poo
But you might give up your hair. You could shave your head and simply use regular soap on your scalp. Most of us aren’t ready to make such a bold style statement in service to the environment. But unlike most other hygiene products, simply going without shampoo is an option.
India’s no-poo (or unpoo) movement encourages people to ditch the shampoo and simply rinse their hair with water. When that’s not enough, no-pooers may use a DIY method involving baking soda and apple cider vinegar. These materials are certainly environmentally friendly and are effective for cleaning. However, depending on your hair type, they may not be very good for your hair. While some people have used this method successfully for years, after a few months, my hair began to resemble the hay under a scarecrow’s hat. It took deep conditioning treatments to avoid the first method suggested – shaving it all off.
Detergent-Free Shampoos
Most shampoos are basically liquid cleansers made from synthetic detergents. Additional chemicals are added for the aesthetics of the product, to create a pleasing color, scent, and texture. Although raw materials only account for about 9% of the product’s environmental footprint, many people avoid synthetic, petroleum-based products on principle.
In particular, many of us want to avoid the detergent SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate or sometimes sodium laureth sulfate) that makes shampoos foamy. Rumors that SLS is a carcinogen seem to be unfounded; however, there may be other health issues. Sulfates like SLS are known skin irritants. They can also remove oils too effectively, leading to dry hair. There are some biodegradable products, like Hairstory New Wash that use essential oils and fatty alcohols instead of detergents.
There is another reason to look for biodegradable shampoo. According to a European life cycle analysis of more than 10,000 personal products referenced throughout the article, disposal accounts for 20% of the environmental footprint of shampoo. That’s because shampoo is not consumed when you use it; all that product rinses off of your hair and ends up in wastewater. Wastewater treatment uses a lot of energy and chemicals, and does not necessarily remove all of the ingredients in shampoo before the water is released into the environment.
Other Chemical Concerns
Surprisingly, shampoo and other common personal care products are significant sources of volatile organic compounds contributing to air pollution. Many shampoos also contain parabens and phthalates. Because the most problematic ingredients are usually found in the perfumes used to scent shampoo, unscented shampoos like Free & Clear or No Nothing Very Sensitive are less likely to contain many of the most harmful chemicals. You can also find more natural, safer shampoos using the Environmental Working Group Verified list. The list includes inexpensive, familiar brands like Herbal Essences as well as less common options like Attitude natural shampoos and Korean beauty brand Whamisa.
Packaging
Plastic bottles dominate among shampoo packaging options. Those bottles account for 22% of shampoos’ environmental impact. Depending on where you live, the plastic from shampoo bottles might be recyclable, but in many places it is not. There are some shampoo brands that use recycled plastic – even recycled beach plastic – to manufacture their bottles. The polyethylene pouches used by Hairstory require much less plastic than bottles and are recyclable where facilities exist.
But there are also plastic-free packaging options. Brands like Alpine Provisions and Plaine Products sell shampoo in aluminum bottles. Lush estimates that their solid shampoo bars prevented 100 metric tons of plastic waste in a year. EWG Verified Soap for Goodness Sake makes a combined shampoo and body bar that comes wrapped in FSC paper.
In fact, most solid shampoo bars are advertised for use on both hair and skin. Many environmentalists follow a rule of thumb that using fewer products creates fewer environmental impacts. There is no specific data in this case to support the principle. But if you find a single cleanser that works for both your hair and body, you will have simplified your life a little.
Clean Technique
No matter what you choose to clean your hair (or shaved scalp), keep in mind that use accounts for 28% of shampoos’ environmental impact. Most of that impact comes from the water you use for washing and the energy needed to heat that water. Use a low-flow showerhead and an efficient water heater. You might also use homemade dry shampoo to stretch the time between washes.

Recycling Mystery: Automobile Floor Mats,"Recycling your automobile floor mats, made from a recyclable thermoelastic polymer (TPE), is challenging due to the unique recycling requirements for the materials. Use this guide to recycle or repurpose these mats effectively, treating the landfill as your last, least attractive option.
When we checked a set of WeatherTech mats, the most popular after-market maker of mats, we found they are made with #7 plastic. This resin number covers the myriad forms of plastic invented since the introduction of the numbering system, and it is not widely accepted for recycling in the United States. While the numbers are presented in a recycling chasing arrow symbol, this does not mean they can be recycled near you or at all. 
Moreover, the unusual shape and size of floor mats make them very problematic for recycling systems. If your recycler does accept the mats, you may need to cut the material into manageable strips before putting them into the system.
WeatherTech encourages the recycling of their floor mats. The company explains that its mats are made of recyclable materials, and while that may be technically accurate, WeatherTech provides no information about how to recycle its products locally. You should look for the recycling symbol and number on the back of the mat to identify the specific type of plastic, and then search Earth911’s database or call your local auto junkyards to see if they want floor mats​. 
Repurpose or Donate
If your local curbside program and transfer station do not take these mats, it’s worth checking with other nearby facilities. Again, check the Earth911 database using the resin number and “rigid” to find local options. Specialty recycling centers and donation programs that handle automotive parts might be able to take them, as car components like mats and carpets are reusable​.
Reuse and Upcycle
These mats are durable and functional in spaces that see a lot of wear or mess.  If recycling is not an option, consider restoring your mats for continued use or repurposing them in the garage, a workshop, or trunk. 
For a more creative solution, upcycle your old car mats. You can turn them into useful items such as coasters, doormats, or planter bases that protect your floor from moisture. Reuse not only prevents the mats from ending up in a landfill but also gives them a new life in a new form​.
Other Floor Mats & Take-Back Programs
Suppose your car came with floor mats that combine plastic, rubber, fabric, or natural fiber. In that case, they are not likely recyclable because the materials cannot be easily separated for processing. So, what to do? The most expedient option is selecting mats made by a company that will take them back, but we have yet to find companies that offer these services. Tell your car dealer, WeatherTech, or any company offering automobile floor mats that you want a responsible, circular product and not just materials that will inevitably end up in a landfill.
By recycling, repurposing, or responsibly disposing of floor mats, you contribute to a cleaner environment.

Recycling Mystery: Water Filters,"Have you recently switched from bottled water to tap water? It’s a good move, environmentally speaking. Single-use plastics account for 40% of the nearly 350 million metric tons of plastic produced annually across the globe. Coca-Cola alone produces the equivalent of 200,000 water bottles a minute.
Many people who forgo bottled water find they don’t like the taste of regular tap water and opt to use water filters. Water filters are a simple way to improve the taste of tap water and to filter out common contaminants like chlorine and lead.
Water Filters Need to Be Replaced Periodically
Water filters have to be replaced regularly in order to keep working as intended. Each style and type of filter operates differently and their replacement times vary. Luckily many water filters have some way of alerting you — such as a blinking light — when they need to be replaced.
The question then becomes: What do I do with my old water filter — are there recycling options? In recent years, the number of options have actually declined, but you can still recycle  water filter.
Types of Water Filters
Before we get into recycling options, let’s be sure we’re taking into account all of the water filters you should replace periodically. Most of us are familiar with the 1- to 2-gallon pitchers that you fill with tap water and run through the filter before drinking.
Here are some other types of water filters you may have in and around your home:

Faucet-mounted filters
Cartridges for refrigerator filters
Under-the-sink filters
Faucet filters
Whole house filters

You probably don’t have all of these, but if you have even a few, that can add up to quite a few water filters. It’s worth looking at where you can recycle them.
Options for Recycling Water Filters
Unfortunately, many water filter manufacturers have discontinued their recycling programs. Mavea has closed its program and now refers customers to their local municipalities. Preserve has also closed its Gimme 5 recycling program.
Hydros has partnered with TerraCycle to create a free mail-back recycling program that accepts any Hydros filter. Request an envelope, fill it with Hydros filters, and ship it back using the prepaid return label. The program is currently limited to the contiguous U.S.
ZeroWater has a recycling program for used ZeroWater 5-stage filter cartridges, as explained in the website’s FAQ. Complete ZeroWater’s form and pay for shipping two or more full-size filters, and ZeroWater will send you a coupon for a discount on your next filter pack.
Editor’s note July 14, 2022: After this article was published, a waiting list was added to Brita’s free recycling program with TerraCycle and there is no indication when it will recommence. 

What About Compostable Water Filters?
There are a few brands out there that are working on creating water filters that have at least partially compostable and/or biodegradable filter components and reusable plastic casings. Most water filters require that both the plastic casing and the inner spongey material (carbon or bamboo) be replaced. TAPP and FIL2R have developed filters that have reusable plastic casings and replaceable filters.
The question of what to do with the inner filter remains. TAPP calls its filters biodegradable and compostable. The company notes that its filters “can be disposed of with organic waste,” which should then make their way to an industrial composting facility. Not everyone has access to those facilities, in which case most people would throw them in the trash. FIL2R states in their sales video that you can throw the activated carbon filter into your home compost pile. You may want to question the wisdom of adding material that has potentially trapped lead, chlorine, and mercury to your home compost.
Pay-to-Recycle Options
In theory, recycling should result in recovered resources that are usable and marketable. Plastic can be melted down to create plastic pellets for manufacturing. Electronics can be mined for their precious metals. Textiles can be shredded and made into insulation or furniture stuffing.
Markets are unpredictable, though, and oftentimes recycling facilities can’t recoup their labor and infrastructure costs from selling materials alone. Also, for harder-to-recycle materials, many facilities don’t have the proper machinery to recover materials. That’s why there are recycling facilities that charge for their services.
Water filter recycling programs that charge a fee are one option to consider if all other options don’t work out.
Additionally, TerraCycle currently offers a Zero Waste Pouch that costs $47 and a Zero Waste Box for $121 for recycling any type of water filter. Shipping is included in the cost.
Check Local Options
There might be local options for hard-to-recycle items like water filters. Call your own curbside recycler, local recycling center, or your department of public works. Any of these may be able to point you in the right direction if they don’t accept water filters themselves.
You can also refer to Earth 911’s recycling database. Type in “water filters” and your ZIP code to find local facilities that take water filters. It’s always a good idea to call before you make a trip, though. Recycling programs frequently make changes to items they accept.

Editor’s note July 14, 2022: After this article was published, a waiting list was added to Brita’s free recycling program with TerraCycle and there is no indication when it will recommence.  What About Compostable Water Filters? There are a few brands out there that are working on creating water filters that have at least partially compostable and/or biodegradable filter components and reusable plastic casings. Most water filters require that both the plastic casing and the inner spongey material (carbon or bamboo) be replaced. TAPP and FIL2R have developed filters that have reusable plastic casings and replaceable filters. The question of what to do with the inner filter remains. TAPP calls its filters biodegradable and compostable. The company notes that its filters “can be disposed of with organic waste,” which should then make their way to an industrial composting facility. Not everyone has access to those facilities, in which case most people would throw them in the trash. FIL2R states in their sales video that you can throw the activated carbon filter into your home compost pile. You may want to question the wisdom of adding material that has potentially trapped lead, chlorine, and mercury to your home compost. Pay-to-Recycle Options In theory, recycling should result in recovered resources that are usable and marketable. Plastic can be melted down to create plastic pellets for manufacturing. Electronics can be mined for their precious metals. Textiles can be shredded and made into insulation or furniture stuffing. Markets are unpredictable, though, and oftentimes recycling facilities can’t recoup their labor and infrastructure costs from selling materials alone. Also, for harder-to-recycle materials, many facilities don’t have the proper machinery to recover materials. That’s why there are recycling facilities that charge for their services. Water filter recycling programs that charge a fee are one option to consider if all other options don’t work out. Additionally, TerraCycle currently offers a Zero Waste Pouch that costs $47 and a Zero Waste Box for $121 for recycling any type of water filter. Shipping is included in the cost. Check Local Options There might be local options for hard-to-recycle items like water filters. Call your own curbside recycler, local recycling center, or your department of public works. Any of these may be able to point you in the right direction if they don’t accept water filters themselves. You can also refer to Earth 911’s recycling database. Type in “water filters” and your ZIP code to find local facilities that take water filters. It’s always a good idea to call before you make a trip, though. Recycling programs frequently make changes to items they accept. Editor’s Note: Originally published on September 22, 2021, this article was updated in April, 2024.

DIY Tealight Candle Holder Made from Pallet Wood,"Looking for sustainable home decor that adds a touch of rustic elegance to any room? A DIY tealight candle holder made from reclaimed wood is just the thing. This guide will show you how to craft a beautiful tealight candle holder using reclaimed wood, minimizing waste and embracing sustainable practices.
Reducing, reusing, and repurposing makes an important difference for the environment By giving new life to discarded wood, we divert it from landfills and conserve precious natural resources. Reclaimed wood boasts unique markings, knots, and textures, adding warmth and rustic charm to your home. By reusing wood, you lower your carbon impact while introducing a weathered look that is hard to match with any commercial lumber treated with stains. Better still, sourcing free or low-cost wood makes this project incredibly affordable, and you won’t need an extensive assortment of expensive materials.
Note: This post contains affiliate links, which helps fund our Recycling Directory, the most comprehensive in North America.
Here’s a rundown of the essential materials you’ll need:
Pallet Wood: Sourced from suitable locations, such as a lumber yard, wood shop, or an abandoned barn, pallet wood can often be obtained for free, or you can buy used planks online, making this project remarkably budget-friendly. Remember, pallet wood isn’t your sole option. Reclaimed wood like decking boards, floorboards, old shelves, or even scraps from your garage or garden shed can suffice. The Spruce has a convenient guide to sourcing used pallets locally. When shopping for foraging, look for “HT” markings that indicate the wood is heat-treated and safe.
Quality Wood Glue: Ensuring your tealight candle holder holds together securely demands the use of high-quality wood glue. While Titebond II is recommended, any reputable brand known for its strength and durability will suffice.
Tealight Candles: Avoid cheap, flimsy tealights from discount stores, as they often lack quality and may burn inconsistently or unsafely. Invest in quality tealights for a better flame and longer, more reliable burn. Try soy wax tealights for cleaner burning flames with the  minimal environmental footprint.
Glass Votive Candle Holders: Essential to this project, glass votive tealight candle holders serve to protect the wood from candle flames and mitigate potential fire hazards. The glass votives we’re using measure 5.5cm (approximately 2.2 inches) wide and 6.7cm (2.6 inches) tall, with many purchasing options available online. Look for used or recycled glass votives for an eco-conscious touch.
The Tools You’ll Need
Opt for hand tools like saws, clamps, and planes whenever possible for a more low impact approach to woodworking. They require less energy and offer a satisfying hands-on experience. However, they do require skill and effort. So consider this too when making a project. If you need tools to do this project, explore local thrift and hardware stores for used tools before buying new ones.
You will need a miter saw or hand saw. Once you’ve disassembled the pallet, you can employ either of these tools to trim the boards to size. A miter saw offers speed and precision, while a hand saw provides a budget-friendly alternative. Opt for a sturdy-bladed hand saw capable of handling tough pallet wood.
Often overlooked but essential, clamps play a crucial role in woodworking projects. Luckily, the ones needed here aren’t costly. Utilize F clamps or G clamps to securely glue the boards together.
Choose your planer wisely. While a lunchbox planer is a valuable tool, it comes with a price tag. If you lack one to flatten the pallet wood boards post-gluing, consider an electric planer or a manual handplane. The lunchbox planer offers speed and consistency, but a hand plane can also be effective albeit requiring more effort and skill. If you don’t have a drill press, ask a neighbor. They are hiding, often little used, in garages and workshops everywhere. Also, you will need a 60mm forstner bit, which is essential for drilling holes to create the flat-bottomed hole for the glass votive tealight candle holders. Standard drill bits won’t suffice due to their inability to match the 60mm diameter.
Simplify the task of drilling tealight candle holes with a drill press, though a drill with a cheap drill guide can achieve similar results. Avoid free-handing, as controlling the large forstner bit required for this project can prove challenging.
You will need to cut the strips in the tealight candle holder with a table saw, track saw, or router allows the candlelight to shine through. While a table saw offers convenience, a trim router presents a more budget-friendly option. Unfortunately, there’s no easy manual alternative for this step. Alternatively, get creative with a drill and modify the design to incorporate drilled holes for the candlelight to shine through.
Step-by-Step Guide
For a step-by-step video tutorial on how to make a pallet wood tealight candle holder, check out our video tutorial on YouTube.
﻿
First, gather your pallet wood. If you’re unsure how to safely dismantle a pallet, refer to our tutorial on the subject.
The cut the boards to their rough length. Trim the pallet boards to a rough length slightly over 30cm. (1.181 inches). Pallet wood typically measures around 2.2cm (0.866 inches) thick, so aim for four boards to create a sturdy block. Adjust dimensions if your wood is thinner.
Glue the boards together, applying wood glue to three sides of the pallet boards, coating the entire surface with a silicone brush, toothbrush, or finger. Clamp the boards together using F clamps, G clamps, or similar, ensuring proper alignment. Allow the glued boards to dry completely overnight or as per the glue manufacturer’s recommendation for a strong bond.
Plane the boards, flattening the top and bottom surfaces of the glued block using a lunchbox planer. Minimize snipe by setting up a planer bed and create a jig to keep the block upright during planing. Alternatively, use a hand plane or electric plane if a planer is unavailable.
Sand the block thoroughly on all sides using a palm belt sander or random orbital sander. Progress from 80 grit to approximately 240 grit to acheive a smooth finish. Hand sanding is an option if power sanders are unavailable.
Mark the candles holders, trimming the block to 29cm length (approximately 11.42 inches), ensuring flat cut ends. Divide the top surface into three equal sections with diagonal lines. Mark the exact center of each section. Drill evenly spaced holes at these points with a 60mm forstner bit, ensuring sufficient depth for glass votives (approximately 7cm).
Cut lateral lines in the block using a table saw to cut down the block’s sides, set at 1cm incements (approximately 0.394 inches — you can adjust as you like) and to a depth of one board thickness. Alternatively, a track saw or trim router can be used. Exercise caution with power tools, ensuring focused attention. Alternatively, get creative with a drill bit for hole cutting. The final dimensions should be 29cm long approximately 11.42 inches), 8.5cm (3.35 inches) wide, and 8.5cm (3.35 inches) high.
Insert the votive tealight candle holders into the block, each with a tealight candle.
You can stain the wood or leave the tealight candle holder unfinished for a natural, weathered look.
Step back and admire your handiwork! Your pallet wood tealight candle holder adds warmth and elegance to any room, a proud testament to your craftsmanship.
Embrace Imperfections & Personalize
Remember, imperfections add character, which is the charm of reclaimed woodcraft. Embrace the unique markings and variations in your reclaimed wood. Feel free to personalize the design with different shapes, sizes, or even pyrography for a truly one-of-a-kind piece.
Crafting with reclaimed materials allows you to express your creativity while minimizing your environmental impact. This DIY tealight candle holder project is a rewarding way to create a beautiful and sustainable piece of home decor that reflects your values and brings joy to your space. So, grab your tools, embrace the upcycling spirit, and embark on this eco-responsible project!

5 Zero-Waste Period Products,"Although period products are relatively small items, nearly 20 billion sanitary napkins, tampons, and applicators end up in landfills in North America each year. The average person who menstruates will do so for about four decades and goes through approximately 9,000 to 10,000 tampons. That adds up to a big environmental impact.
Feminine hygiene products contain cotton, plastic, perfumes, and other synthetic ingredients. In the landfills, they contribute to the production of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. But flushing tampons or other period products is no better; it can cause costly blockages that result in sewage backflow and health hazards, and create an environmental hazard if they enter oceans and other waterways.
Fortunately, zero-waste period products are available that conserve resources and often save money. Let’s explore some of the most earth-friendly products to help you green your period.
Period Underwear
These panties soak up period flow, preventing leaks while keeping moisture away from your skin. Women often use this underwear as a supplemental layer of protection along with a cup, disc, sponge, or tampon, replacing disposable pads and pantiliners. However, some women use period panties in place of other period products.
How To Clean Period Panties
Whenever possible, rinse the underwear in cold water immediately after use. Then, wash it in a washing machine or by hand using cold water and natural soap. Do not use bleach or fabric softener. Either line dry or dry on low heat in a dryer.
We Recommend Aisle Period Underwear
Aisle period underwear can absorb as much as eight tampons, according to the company. Aisle’s leak-proof product is comfortable and eliminates the need for uncomfortable pads and liners. It comes in a wide assortment of colors, styles, and absorbency.
Washable Cloth Pads and Pantyliners
Most disposable pads contain a plastic backing, are bleached, and often contain fragrance. However, there are reusable cloth menstrual pads that can last for years, come in cute patterns, and are more comfortable to use. Although they cost more initially (unless you sew them yourself), they can save a lot of money over time. In addition, cloth pads make a great backup option with a sponge, disc, or cup or for very light flow days.
How To Clean Cloth Pads
Follow the washing directions above for period underwear.
We Recommend Glad Rags
Glad Rags reusable pads and pantyliners come in fun patterns and many different colors. Glad Rags is a Certified B Corporation that uses recycled, recyclable, and biodegradable packaging. Its products are made in the United States, often with local suppliers.
Menstrual Cups
This reusable product is a flexible funnel-shaped cup made of silicone or rubber. Period cups are inserted into the vagina to catch menstrual flow. They are an alternative to tampons and are especially popular for women with a heavy flow.
Some people find menstrual cups a bit challenging to use at first, but many women swear by them once they get comfortable inserting them. You can keep a cup inserted for up to 12 hours at a time. These products are highly durable and will last months or even years.
Smaller cups are typically recommended for women under 30 who have not delivered a baby vaginally. Larger cups are recommended for women over 30, who have given birth or have a heavy monthly flow.
How To Clean Period Cups
After each use, thoroughly rinse the cup and apply a mild soap. There are also cup sprays available, such as the Hello Go Sterilizing Spray, which is ideal in public bathrooms when it’s difficult to discreetly use the sink. After each cycle, boil the cup in water for a few minutes.
We Recommend Cora
Cora makes menstrual cups from soft, medical-grade silicone, which makes them easier to insert and more comfortable to use. This Certified B Corporation also uses a percentage of its profits to provide period products and health education to those in need in India, Kenya, and the United States.
Reusable Period Discs
This product eliminates the need for tampons and collects period blood instead of absorbing it like a sponge or tampon. Although it may seem similar to a period cup, a period disc sits in a slightly different location and is held in place by gravity instead of suction. Discs are folded and inserted into the widest part of the vagina, just before the cervix. Some contain a tab to make them easier to remove.
Both reusable and disposable period discs are available on the market (we recommend reusable), and some brands advertise that they can be worn while having intercourse.
How To Clean Menstrual Discs
Reusable period disks can be washed and used repeatedly, whereas you should use disposable discs only once. To clean your reusable disc, follow the directions above for the menstrual cup.
We Recommend Hello Disc
Hello Disc features a looped tab for easy removal and is made of soft, BPA-free silicone. It holds as much as about three to five tampons and, unlike a period cup, one size fits most women.
Menstrual Sponges
These aquatic organisms are filter feeders and digest plankton and bacteria. Sea sponges are also highly absorbent, and they expand as they retain moisture. When used as a period product, they function similarly to a stringless tampon.
Although some medical experts have concerns about yeast or bacteria in the sponge creating health issues, they are a popular alternative to disposable tampons. They are reusable for up to six months and contain no synthetic ingredients. In addition, many women find them very comfortable because they adjust to the contour of the body.
How To Clean Period Sponges
You should clean sea sponges at least every 8 hours (or less for heavy flow) by rinsing them in water and ringing them out. If desired, use a gentle soap. Periodically, soak the sponge for 5 to 10 minutes in 1 cup of warm water with one of the following ingredients:

1 tablespoon vinegar
2 to 3 drops tea tree essential oil
1 teaspoon hydrogen peroxide
1 tablespoon baking soda

Then, rinse and wring out the sponge. Do not boil period sponges because it makes them shrink and toughen up.
We Recommend Jade & Pearl
Sea Pearls Reusable Sea Sponges from Jade & Pearl are an excellent period product that comes in small, medium, large, or extra-large. Jade & Pearl cleans and trims their products, and the sponges are free of dyes and harsh chemicals.

  Ecoolair: Two High Schoolers Trying To Make A Difference 
  DIY Tealight Candle Holder Made from Pallet Wood","Although period products are relatively small items, nearly 20 billion sanitary napkins, tampons, and applicators end up in landfills in North America each year. The average person who menstruates will do so for about four decades and goes through approximately 9,000 to 10,000 tampons. That adds up to a big environmental impact. Feminine hygiene products contain cotton, plastic, perfumes, and other synthetic ingredients. In the landfills, they contribute to the production of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. But flushing tampons or other period products is no better; it can cause costly blockages that result in sewage backflow and health hazards, and create an environmental hazard if they enter oceans and other waterways. Fortunately, zero-waste period products are available that conserve resources and often save money. Let’s explore some of the most earth-friendly products to help you green your period. Period Underwear These panties soak up period flow, preventing leaks while keeping moisture away from your skin. Women often use this underwear as a supplemental layer of protection along with a cup, disc, sponge, or tampon, replacing disposable pads and pantiliners. However, some women use period panties in place of other period products. How To Clean Period Panties Whenever possible, rinse the underwear in cold water immediately after use. Then, wash it in a washing machine or by hand using cold water and natural soap. Do not use bleach or fabric softener. Either line dry or dry on low heat in a dryer. We Recommend Aisle Period Underwear Aisle period underwear can absorb as much as eight tampons, according to the company. Aisle’s leak-proof product is comfortable and eliminates the need for uncomfortable pads and liners. It comes in a wide assortment of colors, styles, and absorbency. Washable Cloth Pads and Pantyliners Most disposable pads contain a plastic backing, are bleached, and often contain fragrance. However, there are reusable cloth menstrual pads that can last for years, come in cute patterns, and are more comfortable to use. Although they cost more initially (unless you sew them yourself), they can save a lot of money over time. In addition, cloth pads make a great backup option with a sponge, disc, or cup or for very light flow days. How To Clean Cloth Pads Follow the washing directions above for period underwear. We Recommend Glad Rags Glad Rags reusable pads and pantyliners come in fun patterns and many different colors. Glad Rags is a Certified B Corporation that uses recycled, recyclable, and biodegradable packaging. Its products are made in the United States, often with local suppliers. Menstrual Cups This reusable product is a flexible funnel-shaped cup made of silicone or rubber. Period cups are inserted into the vagina to catch menstrual flow. They are an alternative to tampons and are especially popular for women with a heavy flow. Some people find menstrual cups a bit challenging to use at first, but many women swear by them once they get comfortable inserting them. You can keep a cup inserted for up to 12 hours at a time. These products are highly durable and will last months or even years. Smaller cups are typically recommended for women under 30 who have not delivered a baby vaginally. Larger cups are recommended for women over 30, who have given birth or have a heavy monthly flow. How To Clean Period Cups After each use, thoroughly rinse the cup and apply a mild soap. There are also cup sprays available, such as the Hello Go Sterilizing Spray, which is ideal in public bathrooms when it’s difficult to discreetly use the sink. After each cycle, boil the cup in water for a few minutes. We Recommend Cora Cora makes menstrual cups from soft, medical-grade silicone, which makes them easier to insert and more comfortable to use. This Certified B Corporation also uses a percentage of its profits to provide period products and health education to those in need in India, Kenya, and the United States. Reusable Period Discs This product eliminates the need for tampons and collects period blood instead of absorbing it like a sponge or tampon. Although it may seem similar to a period cup, a period disc sits in a slightly different location and is held in place by gravity instead of suction. Discs are folded and inserted into the widest part of the vagina, just before the cervix. Some contain a tab to make them easier to remove. Both reusable and disposable period discs are available on the market (we recommend reusable), and some brands advertise that they can be worn while having intercourse. How To Clean Menstrual Discs Reusable period disks can be washed and used repeatedly, whereas you should use disposable discs only once. To clean your reusable disc, follow the directions above for the menstrual cup. We Recommend Hello Disc Hello Disc features a looped tab for easy removal and is made of soft, BPA-free silicone. It holds as much as about three to five tampons and, unlike a period cup, one size fits most women. Menstrual Sponges These aquatic organisms are filter feeders and digest plankton and bacteria. Sea sponges are also highly absorbent, and they expand as they retain moisture. When used as a period product, they function similarly to a stringless tampon. Although some medical experts have concerns about yeast or bacteria in the sponge creating health issues, they are a popular alternative to disposable tampons.

Ecoolair: Two High Schoolers Trying To Make A Difference,"Ewaste remains a massive problem. We’re two high school students who launched Ecoolair, a solar-powered fan project, to tackle ewaste and deliver affordable, cooler lifestyles.
In March of 2023, CBS News reported that more than 90% of discarded solar panels end up in landfills and as such, by 2030 we are expected to have an area equivalent to approximately 3,000 football fields of retired panels. Next, PIRG noted that in the United States alone, we generate about 6.9 million tons of e-waste each year. Then, they reported WEF’s estimate that we’ll produce around 81.6 million tons of e-waste globally– yearly. Finally, the Brookings Institution found that 23 million US residents are currently living in neighborhoods experiencing intense heat, facing high energy costs, and housing vulnerable residents least able to cope with these impacts.
Hi, we’re Ishita and Danielle. With our solar powered fans, we have a plan to take steps against our current national climate– both personal and environmental. We believe that our community project will contribute to the global efforts in mitigating the current harms our environment and millions of people face.
Hopefully, by the end of this article, you too can help out!
So, Ecoolair? 
Ecoolair is a portmanteau: ECO + cool + air. Get it?
Our narrative unfolds with a single conversation. Reflecting on our journeys back to our homelands, India and The Philippines, we were taken aback by the discovery of a lone commonality– our families were both reluctant to turn on the AC, even as they endured in the heat. We have set ourselves on the distribution of accessible solar powered fans.
What began as a lighthearted exchange evolved into a profound realization: People don’t like the cost of AC, and many can’t even afford it. We realized that this shared phenomenon extended beyond our native lands and resonated in the United States as well. With that began our resolve to implement a solution to what confused us, what we witnessed, and what we experienced.
After conducting extensive research, we have found that old PC fans are an adequate and sustainable material to provide a mode of cooling comfort. Additionally, having them powered by discarded solar panels is a further step towards sustainability. 
This way, we kill three birds with one stone (or at least knock them off their course a little).
Ecoolair’s Big Goal
The bridge between accessibility and affordability of cooling comfort continues to widen day by day. Nationwide, currently, more than half a million public and low-income housing units don’t have air conditioning.
AC units are a luxury more than ever– not everyone is entitled to.
Looking at recent statistics, it is seen that 32,000 deaths and 65,000 hospitalizations were attributable to extreme heat in households or workplaces. These cases were commonly in low-income families, who again were victims to this cooling comfort disparity. Given that temperatures are only expected to spike, it becomes more essential than ever to help address this crisis. 
Ecoolair fans are not only free of cost in terms of purchase, installation, and maintenance, but also poised to eliminate the cooling comfort dilemma burdening our households. Leveraging a readily available energy source, our fans can be implemented in households across the nation.
We aim not only to increase the number of households with access to cooling comfort, but also to decrease hospitalizations resulting from a lack thereof, providing not just an accessible product but a life-saving solution.
By recycling discarded solar panels and PC fans, we actively reduce the environmental impact. This includes lowering the initial 3.4% greenhouse gas emissions associated with production and the leakage of harmful metals (lead and cadmium) from disposed solar panels into the ground. This holistic approach contributes to improved human and environmental health.
Anyone Can Help!
While our aspirations may be high, we need to source discarded PC fans and solar panels. And we need your help!
If you are an individual or you know someone seeking to recycle a computer, we invite you to consider donating PC fans to our cause! Check out our website, or shoot an email to us at ecoolair24@gmail.com and we can work together to figure shipping details out. The same appeal extends to solar panels: if you are exploring ways to recycle them, we would love to be the solution you choose!
If you are an organization whose primary focus is recycling e-waste or solar panels, we kindly ask for your support in donating some of the PC fans or solar panels you receive! For interest in collaboration or affiliation contact us with ecoolair24@gmail.com.
We Can Make a Difference Together
We need all the outreach we can get. If you can, please spread the word. Ecoolair not only has the potential to benefit the environment but also to make a positive impact on your life. By joining forces with us, you take a significant step towards sustainability, embracing the green path. Simultaneously, you contribute to providing cooling comfort – a necessity that should never have been considered a luxury.
All we ask is for your assistance in being our provider for the materials needed to make this project and its mission a reality.
If you’ve reached the end of this article, we express our gratitude for your patience and time, and sincerely hope you’ll consider supporting our cause. Thanks!

All-Natural DIY Bug Spray Recipes That Actually Get the Job Done,"Summer is the time of year for being outside, whether you are picnicking, camping, doing yard work, attending a sporting event, or simply enjoying a glass of wine on your patio. Unfortunately, pesky mosquitos and other bugs can ruin this relaxing time outside. In many cases, bug spray is the only option that will allow you to stay outside without getting eaten alive.
However, most insect repellents available in stores are full of toxic chemicals and carry that overwhelming, cough-inducing stench. Not only are many bug sprays bad for the environment, but they can be detrimental to your health, too. Thankfully, there are several all-natural bug spray options that will keep the bugs away so you can enjoy the outdoors.

Why Use DIY Natural Bug Spray?
For many people, keeping mosquitoes away is a priority, and so is avoiding chemicals such as DEET, which are often present in many commercial insect repellants. DEET (or N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide) is designed to repel, rather than kill insects. It is used by an estimated one-third of the U.S. population and has been linked to numerous neurological problems, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Furthermore, DEET has been shown to have a negative impact on wildlife and water sources in production and during use and it is extremely toxic to birds and aquatic life.
These are just a couple of the main reasons why we think it is important to use a natural bug spray to protect yourself and your kiddos from nasty bug bites. If you are a DIY-er, you can even make a batch of eco-friendly bug spray yourself! Here are a couple of different options for natural bug spray that will keep bugs and insects at bay while you are outside this summer.

Essential Oil Bug Spray
Use the following ingredients to make an all-natural bug spray that is safe for your family and the environment:

Essential oils: choose from citronella, clove, lemongrass, rosemary, tea tree, eucalyptus, cedar, catnip, lavender, or mint
Natural witch hazel or vodka
Distilled or boiled water
Vegetable glycerin

Once you have all the ingredients listed above, fill an 8-ounce spray bottle half full with either distilled or boiled water. Add the witch hazel or vodka to fill almost to the top. Add one-half teaspoon vegetable glycerin along with anywhere from 30 to 50 drops of the essential oil of your choice. Keep in mind that the more oils you use, the stronger your spray will be.
Bug Spray From Fresh or Dried Herbs
Another option for a natural insect repellent is to use fresh or dried herbs. For this recipe, you will need the following:

Distilled water
Witch hazel, vodka, or rubbing alcohol
Dried herbs: choose from peppermint, spearmint, citronella, lemongrass, catnip, or lavender

To make this natural, environmentally responsible repellent, boil one cup of water and add 3 to 4 tablespoons of dried herbs (any combination of the above-listed herbs will work, although it is recommended to use at least one from the mint family). Mix well, cover, and let cool. Once the solution has cooled, strain herbs out and mix with one cup of witch hazel, vodka, or rubbing alcohol. Store in a spray bottle in a cool place, such as the fridge, and use as needed.
These are just a couple of easy, affordable, safe, and natural recipes for insect repellents that will allow you to enjoy being outside without toxic bug sprays. If bees are bombing your barbeque, try this DIY natural bee repellent.

Can You Meet the 60×40 Plastic Reduction Target?,"Earth Day is the one day each year when everyone stops to think about the environment. Even if you’re one of those people who don’t think about the environment very often, by now you probably know that plastic is an environmental problem. This year, Earth Day set a goal to reduce the amount of plastic we all use by 60% before 2040. We can each take steps to reduce our plastic-related impact.
There are so many problems with plastic. Plastic is made from fossil fuel and its manufacture contributes to climate change. Hardly any plastic gets recycled, and a lot of plastic ends up contributing to pollution all around the world.Between 4% and 8% of global oil consumption is related to plastics. In 2015, plastics manufacturing released as much greenhouse gas as 45 million passenger vehicles. In the United States, only about 5% of plastics are recycled each year, while the rest ends up in a landfill, incinerator, or as litter.
Plastic litter can be found everywhere from national parks to giant garbage gyres in the middle of the ocean. The approximate 8 million tons of plastic that enters the ocean each year has some serious effects on sea life. Plastic kills animals from more than 700 different species that ingest or become entangled in it, including at least 1000 sea turtles every year. Microplastics bioaccumulate in the marine food chain, but seafood is only one source (alongside chewing gum and bottled water) of the plastic consumed by humans. Microplastics have been found in human blood, lungs, and placentas – this last is only one of the reasons that infants are at elevated health risk from plastic exposure [internal link pending].
60×40
For several years, ending plastic pollution has been a major focus of EarthDay.org’s efforts. Although EarthDay.org has advocated for the elimination of plastic, especially single-use plastic, for years, for Earth Day 2024, a new 60×40 plastic reducti0n campaign is setting a clear target for action. Perhaps modeled after the successful international adoption of the 30×30 conservation goal, EarthDay’s new campaign is demanding a 60% reduction in the production of plastics by 2040, with the ultimate goal of achieving a post-plastic future. The key areas of the campaign include:

Raising awareness of the plastic threat to human health
Advocating for the elimination of single-use plastic products
Putting an end to fast fashion, and
Investing in innovative technologies and alternative materials to replace plastic.

Earth Day Action
If you haven’t already, sign the petition to support the global plastics treaty. The fourth of five rounds of negotiations for the treaty will take place in Ottawa, Canada from April 23-29. At the last round, a minority of mostly fossil fuel-producing nations in an informal “group of like-minded countries” (including Iran, the Russian Federation, and Saudi Arabia) did their best to weaken the draft treaty. While at least some of the U.S. delegates favor a strong treaty, America’s record on international environmental treaties is spotty at best. Public support is crucial to U.S. action.
Next, email your representatives in Congress to support the Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act. Take up EarthDay.org’s #PlasticDetox Challenge and share your plastic swaps on social media using the hashtag #PlasticDetox. Calculate your plastic footprint and download EarthDay’s Plastic Pollution Primer for understanding the plastic pollution problem and how you can make a difference toward solving it.  For a more hands-on Earth Day, join in the Great Global Cleanup and clean up plastic litter from a beach, park, or riparian area near you.
Personal Plastic Prevention
As they say, Earth Day is every day, so after April 22 keep up your efforts to become plastic-free. Start with simple changes like mindful shopping and finding alternatives for the single-use plastics that you use the most. Earth911 is a trove of information and resources to help you eliminate plastic waste.
You can support local plastic bans, reduce plastic waste when you eat out or in your own kitchen, and when you shop for produce or look for plastic-free packaging at the grocery store. We’ve got tips to help you eliminate plastic in the form of synthetic fabrics (or wear them more sustainably) and build a more sustainable wardrobe, and even use less plastic when you get a drink of water or go to a concert  or take a flight. Plastics have infiltrated every aspect of modern life. On the one hand, that makes eliminating them a big job. But it also means that you have lots of opportunities to make a difference.

Recycling LEGO Bricks: A Sustainable Solution From Brick Recycler,"Over 1 trillion LEGO bricks have been manufactured since the mid-1950s when the company began using ABS plastic, which most curbside recycling programs do not accept. It’s time for reuse with a LEGO touch. Enter Brick Recycler, an innovative initiative dedicated to repurposing and recycling LEGO pieces, effectively diverting them from landfills and reintegrating them into cycles of play and learning. 
LEGO produces more than 60 billion new LEGO bricks, which means hundreds of billions of unused LEGO pieces lie in storage or contribute to the increasing pile in landfills. Brick Recycler invites individuals to donate their unused LEGO bricks by mail. The bricks are sorted and redistributed to extend the lifecycle of LEGO pieces, making them accessible to children and educational programs nationwide, which benefit from their durability.
Why Regular Recycling Centers Can’t Handle LEGO Bricks
LEGO bricks pose a unique recycling challenge. Composed of ABS plastic, rubber, and, sometimes, electrical components, they are seldom accepted by traditional curbside recycling centers in major U.S. cities. Many thrift stores need more staffing to sort mixed brick collections, so they are often discarded. 
Brick Recycler can handle and sort all LEGO donations, partnering with numerous charities to distribute millions of LEGO pieces to foster homes, children’s groups, orphanages, at-risk youth programs, schools, and artists. Through these partnerships, the organization ensures that the educational and creative value of LEGO bricks is not only preserved but also extended to underprivileged groups and developing regions.

Guest Opinion: Planting Trees Can Save the Planet,"In the face of escalating environmental challenges, we can’t sit idly by. It’s up to us to tackle the harmful impacts our actions are having on the planet head-on. Look around, and you’ll see a landscape marked by climate change, deforestation, and the loss of biodiversity. These issues aren’t just distant threats—they’re staring us in the face, jeopardizing ecosystems and the future of generations to come. That’s why we urgently need to explore sustainable solutions that can stem the tide of damage humans have caused.
The relationship between trees and climate change is profound. Trees help regulate global temperatures by absorbing carbon dioxide and storing carbon in their biomass. Reforestation—the act of planting trees on a large scale—is a powerful weapon in our arsenal against climate change. Not only does it sequester carbon, but it also strengthens ecosystems and fosters biodiversity. And as trees mature, their carbon-storing abilities only grow stronger, making reforestation a key strategy in our fight against climate change.
But trees do more than just regulate temperatures. They also influence weather patterns, precipitation, and humidity levels, shaping the climate in ways we’re only beginning to understand. By planting trees strategically, we can not only mitigate the impacts of climate change but also adapt to a rapidly changing world.
Trees aren’t just passive bystanders in the environmental drama unfolding around us—they’re powerful allies in our battle against climate change. They excel at absorbing carbon dioxide from the air and storing it in their biomass, which helps reduce the greenhouse effect. In other words, they’re like superheroes, fighting to keep our planet cool and habitable. But their powers don’t stop there. Through the magic of photosynthesis, trees churn out oxygen, giving us the air we need to breathe. They’re not just purifiers of the air; they’re essential for sustaining life on Earth. Plus, they provide homes for countless plant and animal species, fostering biodiversity and keeping ecosystems healthy. And when we mess up—when we clear forests or wreak havoc on the environment—trees step in to help, restoring ecosystems and healing the damage we’ve caused.
Embracing Technology: Innovations in Afforestation
Afforestation is like hitting the reset button on areas where trees have been lost. It’s about planting new trees, restoring ecosystems, and giving nature a fighting chance. Deforestation, on the other hand, is like a wrecking ball, tearing down forests and wreaking havoc on the environment. It leads to biodiversity loss, disrupts ecosystems, and fuels climate change.
Technological advancements, particularly the utilization of drones, are revolutionizing traditional tree-planting methods. Drones equipped with seeding devices can rapidly and precisely cover vast areas, enhancing afforestation efficiency. This innovative approach not only accelerates the process but also enables targeted seed distribution, optimizing successful growth. It exemplifies the transformative potential of technology in large-scale afforestation efforts.
Moreover, technology extends to monitoring and managing forests beyond the planting phase. Satellite imaging, sensors, and data analytics facilitate real-time tracking of forest health, growth rates, and potential threats. This data-driven approach empowers forest managers to make informed decisions, ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of afforestation projects. Advanced technologies enhance our capacity to understand, preserve, and maximize the ecological benefits of planted forests.
Restorative Impact of Tree-Planting Projects
Recent studies have provided compelling evidence regarding the restorative impact and long-term permanence of tree-planting projects. These findings underscore the importance of such initiatives in mitigating environmental degradation and combating climate change.
Firstly, USDA research has shown that tree-planting projects can significantly contribute to carbon sequestration, thereby reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Trees act as natural carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and storing it in their biomass. Over time, this process helps offset carbon emissions from various sources, including industrial activities and transportation. Moreover, studies have indicated that well-planned and managed reforestation efforts can lead to substantial carbon storage in forests, making them effective tools for climate change mitigation.
Furthermore, tree-planting projects have been found to have positive impacts on biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration. By creating habitats for a diverse range of plant and animal species, reforestation initiatives promote ecological resilience and support the recovery of degraded landscapes. These projects also contribute to soil stabilization, water regulation, and the prevention of erosion, thereby enhancing the overall health and functioning of ecosystems.
In addition to their environmental benefits, tree-planting projects can have significant social and economic impacts. They provide employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas where livelihoods may depend on natural resources. Moreover, community-based reforestation initiatives can empower local residents and foster a sense of ownership and stewardship over forest resources.
Before You Support: Assessing an Organization
Here are some factors to consider when choosing which tree-planting project:
Mission and Goals Check. Review the organization’s mission to ensure alignment with your values. Seek specific goals, like funds allocated to projects or trees planted per order, typically on their About Us page, ensuring your support goes where it matters most.
Transparency and Accountability. Does the organization provide detailed project information, budgets, timelines, and outcomes? Ensure supporters can track planted trees and monitor project progress for openness and accountability.
Partnerships and Collaborations. Examine affiliations with other entities to enhance tree-planting efforts. Robust partnerships with organizations, companies, and communities can amplify resources and expertise. Look for a dedicated partners page for insights.
Community Engagement Assessment. Genuine community engagement is essential for project success. Check for community reviews to gauge legitimacy and conduct a quick Google search to determine their legitimacy: “Is organization X is legit?” while keeping in mind that many reviews are fake. Actually talking with the project, by calling or sending email to ask pointed questions, is the best defense against misleading tree-planting offers.
Stay Active and Inquisitive. Be proactive and ask their support for updates on recent initiatives and projects. Inquire about sustainability practices, volunteer opportunities, and methods for measuring project impact.
By following these steps, you can conduct a thorough assessment of a tree planting project before engaging and ensure that your participation contributes to positive environmental and social outcomes
Remember, it’s all about the small steps
As individuals, we may find it challenging to address large-scale issues alone. Yet, by assisting and backing the right organizations, we can tackle problems incrementally, one step at a time.
In the end, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of destruction, or we can choose to plant the seeds of change. Whether it’s planting trees in our own yards, organizing tree-planting events with our neighbors, or supporting nationwide reforestation projects, every action matters. Together, let’s make a tangible impact and ensure a thriving environment for ourselves and future generations.

Earth Day Adventures: Six Family-Friendly Activities to Connect with Nature,"Earth Day, coming up on April 22nd, is a global event dedicated to connecting us to our planet and promoting environmental awareness. Family members can connect with each other and nature, teaching children about sustainability. Earth Day is the perfect opportunity for fun and educational Spring outdoor adventures. Here are six family-friendly activities to help you celebrate Earth Day and foster a deeper connection across generations. 
Plant a Family Garden That Supports Pollinators

Starting a pollinator garden is a great way to teach kids about the importance of plants and pollinators in our ecosystem. Choose native plants or vegetables that thrive in your area to reduce water usage and support local wildlife. 
Participate in a Community Cleanup
Joining a local cleanup event is a hands-on way to teach children about litter prevention and the importance of keeping our communities clean. EarthDay.org lists community cleanup events around Earth Day, providing an excellent opportunity for families to contribute volunteer time to clean up and preserve their local environment. Or, if you can’t find a local event, start one yourself by following the steps in this guide.
Explore Local Trails
Explore local hiking trails or nature reserves to discover the natural beauty in your area. This activity encourages physical exercise and offers a chance to learn about different plant and animal species. Websites like AllTrails.com can help you find family-friendly trails for hiking, biking, walking the dog, or that are wheelchair-accessible near your address.
Start Learning To Repair and Reuse

If the outdoors isn’t your thing, consider taking steps to ease your impact on the planet. Learn to do your own repairs of furniture, electronics, bikes or tools that would otherwise be tossed in the trash when the first problem crops up — visit a community repair event to gest started. Making things last can help offest the carbon emissions associated with making them in the first place. And if you want to join the an important movement, look into reuse, which encourages finding reusable alternatives to single-use and short-lived products to encourage the circular economy.

How To Make A DIY Clay Pot Heater With Reclaimed Wood Base,"Staying warm on a budget or just adding a rustic touch to your home is easy with a terracotta pot heater. Learn how to stay warm without breaking the bank by building a DIY clay pot heater at home. This easy project will help you escape the cold and create a cozy atmosphere in your home.
For a detailed walkthrough of the process, check out our DIY clay pot heater tutorial video on YouTube.

Materials Required
Luckily, this heater project doesn’t demand a long shopping list. Plus, the items needed are readily available and won’t break the bank. Bonus!

1x Large Terracotta Plant Pot
1x Medium Terracotta Plant Pot
1x 10M Threaded Bar
8x 10M Nuts
1x 10M Nyloc Nut
6x 10M Washers (large enough to cover the holes in the terracotta pots)
1x Base (I made a circular wooden base out of reclaimed wood, but you can use a terracotta plant pot base if woodworking isn’t your thing)
4x Tealight Candles

While stainless steel threaded bar, nuts, and washers are an alternative, they come at a higher cost. Some online comments caution against using galvanized threaded rod and nuts or washers due to potential zinc oxidation and the emission of toxic gases. Upon investigation, zinc oxidizes at 1600 °F, a temperature tealight candles don’t reach. Moreover, positioning the candles far from the threaded rod eliminates direct heating, making safety concerns unwarranted. After an 8-hour test run, neither the rod nor the nuts or washers emitted any odor, visible gases, or discoloration, indicating the setup’s safety.
You will start by making a circular wooden base from scrap wood. This is safe, as heat rises and doesn’t affect the wood given the wax is contained within the aluminium tealight cups.
Time Investment
Making the circular wooden base and assembling the terracotta pots and hardware takes about an hour. If you opt out of making the reclaimed wood base, the project will be quicker.
Step-by-Step Guide

First, construct a neat wooden base to accommodate the tealight candles and hardware.
Glue and dowel two pieces of 3cm (1.18 inches) thick pine offcuts, letting them set overnight.
Next, square the wood to fit the terracotta pot you have. We went with approximately 25cm by 25cm (9.8 inches x 9.8 inches).
Create a circle cutting jig for the table saw to cut the circle, a process not covered in this tutorial. Once set up, it will make quick work of cutting the wood.
Dividing the circle into four squares, drill a 40mm (1.6 inches) hole in the center of each to hold the tealights. This maintains a safe distance between candles to prevent flash burns. Using a forstner bit ensures a flat bottom, and leaves the tealights slightly protruding for easy removal.
Then, drillea 40mm (1.6 inches) recess in the base to accommodate a nut and washer, and a 10mm (4/10s of an inch) hole all the way through the center for the threaded bar.
Using an angle grinder, cut a section of the threaded rod to approximately 30cm, roughly gauging the required length against the pots and marking it with a permanent marker. Since threaded bar only comes in 1-meter (39.4 inches) lengths, you may need to do the same. Alternatively, a hacksaw can be used if an angle grinder is unavailable.
Next, use a router with a coving bit to add a decorative flair to the base and facilitate easy lifting.
To prevent slippage during use, affix small rubber strips to the base with epoxy.
While the wooden base complemented the pots nicely, you can use an upturned terracotta plant pot base if woodworking isn’t feasible. Placing the pots on bricks is also an option but lacks aesthetic appeal.
Secure a nyloc nut and washer to one end of the threaded bar and recessed it into the wooden base. We opted for a nyloc nut for added security, as it supports the entire structure, preventing loosening. Due to space constraints, recessing two nuts within the 3cm (1.8 inches) base thickness wasn’t feasible without compromising integrity.
Proceeded to build the structure as follows:


1 washer, then 2 nuts to secure the base’s top.
2 nuts, followed by a washer to support the medium-sized terracotta pot. Adjust as needed for desired height, leaving a 3cm air gap for airflow and ease of tealight placement.
The medium terracotta pot.
1 washer, 2 nuts, then another washer to separate the medium pot from the large one.
The large terracotta pot.
Finally, capped off with 1 washer and 2 nuts.


Tighten each set of nuts as you go, using two spanners if necessary.

How to Use
Using the terracotta pot heater is a breeze. Place four tealights in the recesses and light them in place with matches or a stove lighter. It takes approximately 45 minutes for the pots to heat up, and the tealights burn for about 4 hours.
While the heater won’t win awards for heating large spaces, it does provide a cozy atmosphere and helps dry out the air. We didn’t conduct rigorous scientific tests, but it made our small lounge more comfortable. Plus, it doubles as a charming hand warmer. Just remember:

Never leave the heater unattended.
Avoid covering the heater; the terracotta pots get hot!
Use only tealights, not candles, as they come in a metal cup, preventing wax spills and igniting.
Refrain from moving the heater once lit to prevent spilled wax.
Opt for high-quality, unscented tealights, as scented ones may cause flash burns.
Exercise caution when blowing out the tealights to prevent wax spray.
For added safety tips, refer to candle safety guidelines.

With these precautions in mind, enjoy the cozy warmth and ambiance of your homemade terracotta pot heater!

Guest Opinion: The Role of Plant-Based Medicine in Sustainable Healthcare,"Sustainable healthcare aims to reduce waste, pollution, and energy usage associated with traditional healthcare procedures. It also attempts to increase operational performance and cut costs while minimizing environmental impacts. What is the most beneficial factor that can help achieve high-quality care? Plant-based medicines might hold the answer. 
The World Health Organization reports  that traditional medicines involve several different methods of disease prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. Medicinal plants are a significant aspect of medicines throughout. Plants provide crucial elements of the healthcare system for around 80% of the world’s population. Additionally, they contribute to the synthesis of many pharmacological substances.
The integration of social, economic, environmental, and ecological aspects is of the utmost importance in conceptualizing sustainable healthcare as a comprehensive strategy. Health outcomes are recognized as subject to the effect of wider social and environmental factors. 
Why Choose Sustainable Healthcare?
Medicinal plants have documented their use in healthcare for millennia, with extensive worldwide research demonstrating their effectiveness. The market value of plant-based medicines surpasses $100 billion annually worldwide. Failing to adopt a sustainable healthcare strategy will exacerbate the environmental impact linked to the healthcare sector. 
Several factors may contribute to the anticipated increase in healthcare spending and resource usage in the next few decades, including: 

population growth, 
the increasing prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles, 
the growth of chronic disease as lifespans increase, 
the aging of populations, and 
the need for enhanced accessibility to healthcare services. 

Plant-Based Medicine Versus Conventional Medicine
The cost of getting treatment after you get sick increases daily. Pharmaceutical medications targeting illnesses are more expensive to develop, typically more than $1 billion and as much as $4.2 billion. Plant-based remedies exert a broader spectrum of effects on the physical system. Even though they are less targeted, natural remedies can closely mimic the properties of pharmaceuticals. Although plant-based medicines may take time to deliver relief, they can be effective; they are also less expensive as compared to conventional drugs. 
Typically, designers of plant-based medications aim to promote healing with milder therapeutic impact. However, plant-based therapies can fail because of plant misidentification, poor planning, and inappropriate medicine administration.
Despite the recent introduction of synthetic pharmaceuticals into Western medicine, we place more faith in them than natural remedies that have existed for millennia. Our confidence stems from our new, extensive understanding of their physiological impacts on the human body.
Synthetic drugs undergo a higher level of standardization than natural treatments. Rigorous adherence to stringent standard operating procedures is observed throughout the preparation process, ensuring that each batch maintains a consistent level of quality comparable to its predecessor. 
In contrast, plant-based medicine makers do not adhere to controlled methods, although certain norms apply in Asia. Herbal medications exhibit complex properties and have multifaceted effects on the human body. Currently, our understanding of their safety and effectiveness is incomplete. Consequently, batches of herbal medications may exhibit varying quality levels. The manufacture of herbal medicines encompasses several aspects, including:

The classification of plants and their constituent components.
Source. 
Methods of extraction.

However, natural products can be safer than manufactured medications. A study by the U.S. National Institute of Health suggests that about 8% of hospitalizations in the United States are attributable to the adverse side effects of synthetic medicines.
Health Benefits of Plant-Based Medicine
Recent research has shown that ginger, turmeric, and cannabis possess the ability to successfully mitigate chronic pain, presenting a reliable and efficient substitute for traditional pharmaceutical interventions in the management of enduring pain, including joint, nerve, and chronic pain conditions. These proven medications effectively manage various persistent pain disorders.
Heart conditions are among the leading causes of death in the world, claiming 17.9 million lives every year. Coronary artery disease is characterized by plaque formation within artery walls. Herbal medicines can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by obstructing blood clot formation and lowering lipid levels that can contribute to arterial sclerosis. Natural psychedelics can reduce stress, as well.

For decades, researchers have utilized plant-based medicines in treating cancer, deriving several chemotherapeutic drugs from these botanical sources. For example, Albizia Lebbeck, an Australian flowering plant can treat sarcoma and the African spider plant, Gynandropsis Pentaphylla, is used on Hepatoma, a common form of liver cancer. These medications function by eliminating or suppressing cancer cells and bolstering the body’s immune system, assisting in the battle against malignant cells. Due to their beneficial impacts, their popularity is increasing.
Plant-based remedies, including turmeric, ginger, and rosemary, have long been employed in Indian and Chinese medicine to alleviate inflammation. If somebody wishes to reduce and manage their pain and help with inflammation, then turmeric is the answer. It manages pain efficiently and also has anti-inflammatory properties. In contrast, ginger is renowned for its ability to mitigate vertigo symptoms and gastrointestinal distress. Due to its intrinsic antioxidant characteristics, Rosemary can treat a variety of health concerns for millennia. Rosemary use has even been shown to improve memory function.
Challenges & Opportunities: Implementing Plant-Based Medicine in Healthcare
A worldwide revival of alternative healthcare systems is driving significant growth in the herbal medication business, highlighting the considerable economic significance of medicinal plants. However, many significant challenges hinder the rise of herbal medicine, including the loss of biodiversity, excessive exploitation and improper use of medicinal plants, industrialization, bio-piracy, and inadequate regulation and infrastructure. 
In the 21st century, the increase in herbal medicine use relies on conservation, rigorous study grounded in traditional knowledge, stringent quality control measures for herbal medicine, and meticulous record keeping. Nature always gives us more than we can ever return. 
Integrating plant-based medicine into sustainable healthcare offers a promising solution to modern health challenges while reducing environmental impact. Problems like inadequate regulation and dwindling biodiversity must be addressed by governments. Embracing plant-based medicine within sustainable healthcare represents a shift towards equitable, accessible healthcare and preserving natural resources. These efforts should focus on improving medicinal plants’ efficiency, effectiveness, and logical use. We can achieve this by incorporating plant-based medicines into national, regional, and municipal health strategies and initiatives. Incorporating medicinal plants into all facets of primary health care is crucial.

Collaboration between countries and communities is essential, along with raising public awareness about the benefits of plant-based medicine. By collectively embracing these actions, we can promote sustainable healthcare, improve health outcomes, and preserve natural resources globally. Let’s commit to better health for the upcoming years by trying to implement more natural medicines for better sustainable healthcare.

  Earth Day Adventures: Six Family-Friendly Activities to Connect with Nature","Sustainable healthcare aims to reduce waste, pollution, and energy usage associated with traditional healthcare procedures. It also attempts to increase operational performance and cut costs while minimizing environmental impacts. What is the most beneficial factor that can help achieve high-quality care? Plant-based medicines might hold the answer.  The World Health Organization reports  that traditional medicines involve several different methods of disease prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. Medicinal plants are a significant aspect of medicines throughout. Plants provide crucial elements of the healthcare system for around 80% of the world’s population. Additionally, they contribute to the synthesis of many pharmacological substances. The integration of social, economic, environmental, and ecological aspects is of the utmost importance in conceptualizing sustainable healthcare as a comprehensive strategy. Health outcomes are recognized as subject to the effect of wider social and environmental factors.  Why Choose Sustainable Healthcare? Medicinal plants have documented their use in healthcare for millennia, with extensive worldwide research demonstrating their effectiveness. The market value of plant-based medicines surpasses $100 billion annually worldwide. Failing to adopt a sustainable healthcare strategy will exacerbate the environmental impact linked to the healthcare sector.  Several factors may contribute to the anticipated increase in healthcare spending and resource usage in the next few decades, including:  population growth,  the increasing prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles,  the growth of chronic disease as lifespans increase,  the aging of populations, and  the need for enhanced accessibility to healthcare services.  Plant-Based Medicine Versus Conventional Medicine The cost of getting treatment after you get sick increases daily. Pharmaceutical medications targeting illnesses are more expensive to develop, typically more than $1 billion and as much as $4.2 billion. Plant-based remedies exert a broader spectrum of effects on the physical system. Even though they are less targeted, natural remedies can closely mimic the properties of pharmaceuticals. Although plant-based medicines may take time to deliver relief, they can be effective; they are also less expensive as compared to conventional drugs.  Typically, designers of plant-based medications aim to promote healing with milder therapeutic impact. However, plant-based therapies can fail because of plant misidentification, poor planning, and inappropriate medicine administration. Despite the recent introduction of synthetic pharmaceuticals into Western medicine, we place more faith in them than natural remedies that have existed for millennia. Our confidence stems from our new, extensive understanding of their physiological impacts on the human body. Synthetic drugs undergo a higher level of standardization than natural treatments. Rigorous adherence to stringent standard operating procedures is observed throughout the preparation process, ensuring that each batch maintains a consistent level of quality comparable to its predecessor.  In contrast, plant-based medicine makers do not adhere to controlled methods, although certain norms apply in Asia.

Keeping Cool: The Surprising Summer Benefit of Home Insulation,"As the planet warms, summers are getting hotter, making it crucial to find effective ways to keep our homes cool. While most people think of insulation as essential for keeping homes warm in winter, its benefits during the sweltering summer months are just as significant. 
Proper insulation and sealing keeps cool air in and the hot air out, reducing the need for air conditioning and lowering energy bills. Here are seven steps to ensure your home is well-insulated against the summer heat.
Seal Windows and Doors. Unsealed cracks and gaps around windows and doors let colder air inside the home escape. Applying weather stripping or caulking to these areas can also prevent hot air from entering the house, enhancing the efficiency of your air conditioning or heat pump system — they’ll need to run less often. Here are seven more ideas to help you make weatherization progress.

Upgrade Attic Insulation. Heat rises, and without proper attic insulation, it can easily penetrate your living spaces. Upgrading your attic insulation can block heat transfer from the roof, keeping your home cooler and reducing the burden on your air conditioning. Check out local utilities’ incentives and financing for upgrades.

Install Radiant Barriers: In hot climates, radiant barriers in the attic and roofing can reflect heat away from your home. These barriers, typically reflective materials, can significantly reduce heat gain through the roof, keeping your home cooler.
Enhance Wall Insulation: Adding insulation to exterior walls can prevent outdoor heat from seeping into your home. This step can be particularly effective in older homes that may need more insulation.
Use Insulated Curtains or Blinds: Thermal curtains or blinds can block sunlight and heat from entering through windows. This decor-enhancing solution can make a noticeable difference in maintaining cooler indoor temperatures.
Insulate Ductwork: If your home has ducted air conditioning, ensuring that the ductwork is properly insulated can prevent cool air loss and improve the efficiency of your system. Leaky ducts are significant sources of energy waste and uneven cooling.
Consider Insulating Paint or Additives: Technological advancements have developed insulating paint products and additives that can reflect heat. Applying these products to your home’s exterior can help keep indoor spaces cooler, reducing electricity use and costs.
These insulation strategies can make your home more comfortable during the hot summer months while contributing to energy conservation and reduced utility expenses. As climate change makes summer hotter, taking proactive steps to enhance your home’s insulation is a smart, sustainable choice for the planet and your wallet.

Recycling Mystery: Tires,"Let’s be honest: Tires make the world go ’round. Unless you’re a professional speed walker, your method of transportation probably involves tires of some sort. But tires don’t last forever. Whether it’s an irreparable flat or loss of tread, eventually tires need to be replaced. Some tires can be retreaded for a second life, but what happens to tires when they’re no longer safe for driving? Let’s break down the ins and outs of recycling and properly disposing of your worn-out tires.
The Great Rubber Mountain
If you don’t see value in recycling tires, let us introduce you to the concept of stockpiles, acres of tires stacked by the thousands in one concentrated area.
Tire stockpiles can lead to a number of unpleasant situations:

They are breeding grounds for mosquitoes and vermin, especially when they are filled with rainwater.
They are prone to catching fire. Since tires are made largely of oil, the fires are difficult to extinguish (some can last for months) and produce an acrid, black smoke.

According to the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association, more than 1 billion scrap tires were in stockpiles in the United States in 1990. State efforts to clean up stockpiles have made progress, but by 2017, around 60 million tires were still stockpiled in the U.S.
Responsibly disposing of scrap tires is a huge task. In the U.S. alone, 280 million tires are discarded annually. Image courtesy of The Tire Zoo
Fuel ‘er Up
The U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association reported that in 2019, 43% of annual scrap tire generation was burned for energy, also known as tire-derived fuel (TDF). Using pyrolosis, an energy intensive, often carbon-emitting process, tires can be converted into energy comparable to crude oil or coal. The Rubber Manufacturer’s Association estimates that the average passenger car tire produces over two gallons of oil when burned. Another output of tire pyrolosis is carbon black, which is used to make new tires, ink, and a variety of products.
More than 40% of TDF goes to cement kilns for pyrolosis, but other uses include paper factories and electric companies. This means that keeping tires out of landfills affects the ground you walk on, the paper you write on, and the lights in your home and office. TDF requires that tires be shredded first, since whole tires would be too large for a furnace. Shredding recovers much of the metal in a tire, such as the rim and lead weights used for balance. The metal can be extracted and recycled, leaving crumb rubber to use as fuel.
The Dirt on Disposal
Tires can be recycled into new products, and most of these uses take place after shredding since there is more demand for crumb rubber than whole tires.
Crumb rubber can be used as the surface for playgrounds because its soft padding helps prevent injuries. However, there has been debate over this use because of the potential toxins that tires may release, including lead and mercury. In response to these claims, the EPA conducted studies into the exposure rates to residual chemicals playing on fields using crumb rubber. The studies found that while there were chemical traces still present, human exposure appeared to be limited.
But in March 2022, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a report pointing to a number of chemicals of concern found in playground surfaces made from recycled tires. Benzo(a)puyrene, a carcinogen when inhaled, and zinc that can be ingested after a child gets it on their hands, were called out, among other substances, as being a concern over periods of long exposure.
Old tires even have a purpose in construction. Rubberized asphalt can be used to make longer-lasting roads that produce less traffic noise and is popular in many states. Its absorbing qualities also make it ideal for running tracks, causing less stress for runners’ legs.
Lastly, tires can be recycled into new tires by converting them into synthetic rubber. This is not a common solution because of the cost involved. But it could become a more popular solution in the future if improved technology can make it more cost-effective.
The Next Time You Get a Flat
The most important question still remains: How do you actually recycle tires? For starters, many retailers that sell tires will accept a limited number when you make a purchase. If you’re shopping for new tires, be sure to ask if they will recycle your old tires.
Forty-eight states have a waste tire plans, which would be administered by your state environmental department. Many of these programs involve a small charge, ranging from $3 to $5 per tire sold, that contribute to supporting tire recycling. Most states require recyclers to file for a permit to accept tires, so they will also know of locations that accept tires for recycling.
If you can’t find anywhere to dispose of your old tires, consider a way to reuse them. You can build a tire swing for the kids, use them as a planter in your backyard, build a sandbox for your children, or even turn them into household furniture!

You can build a tire swing for the kids, use them as a planter in your backyard, build a sandbox for your children, or even turn them into household furniture! Feature image courtesy of Alex.

Recycling Mystery: Ice Cream Cartons,"I scream, you scream, we all scream when it comes to recycling ice cream cartons. Given that the average American consumes 20 pounds of ice cream each year, that’s a lot of packaging. So, are ice cream cartons recyclable?
As you probably know, the base material for ice cream cartons is paper — specifically, paperboard. This is the same material used for cereal and other food boxes, with a layer of clay called kaolin on the outside that allows the manufacturer to print branding, ingredients and other information.
But ice cream cartons are made of a special type of paper called wet-strength paperboard, which includes a plastic lining of polyethylene to ensure that it won’t break down in the freezer under extreme temperatures. Other examples of wet-strength paperboard include frozen food boxes and beer/soda carriers.
That polyethylene coating poses a recycling challenge because the process for recycling paper involves adding water to turn it into pulp. The polyethylene is water resistant and prevents the pulping process.
A City-by-City Solution
Ice cream carton acceptance in curbside recycling programs is by no means standardized in the U.S., and you can’t even predict its acceptance by region. In Seattle, they are accepted for recycling, while in Portland, they are not, even though these cities are less than 200 miles from each other and often both cited as examples of green cities. The same can be said of Austin, Texas, where they are accepted, but not Fort Worth, which are also less than 200 miles apart.
A good rule of thumb is to look at the list of materials accepted in your local curbside program. If you don’t see either frozen food boxes or ice cream cartons specifically mentioned by name, don’t include them with your recyclables.
If your community doesn’t accept ice cream cartons, there’s not a viable alternative for you. Even if you compost at home, your bin will likely not get hot enough to break down the plastic lining of wet-strength paperboard.
Carton Preparation
If you are in a community that accepts ice cream cartons for recycling, be sure to empty out all remaining ice cream before you recycle, and give the carton a quick rinse.
This is important because if you recycle a carton that still contains ice cream, the ice cream will melt and contaminate your other recyclables — not to mention leave your bin sticky and attractive to wasps and other pests.

9 Alternatives to Single-Use Plastic Straws,"Single-use plastic straws are an environmental problem that few people think about. But consider the popularity of drinks like fountain sodas, iced lattes and bubble teas; all the accompanying plastic straws add up to a lot of plastic waste.
According to Australian researchers, as many as 8.3 billion plastic straws litter the world’s beaches, roughly one for every living human. Those straws are difficult to recycle and seldom accepted by curbside programs or at transfer centers, but most importantly they add to the plastic catastrophe happening in our oceans.
By switching to a reusable, you’ll reduce the demand for single-use polypropylne (#5 plastic) straws, the manufacturing of which produces about 1.5 grams of CO2 emissions. That may not sound like much, but the approximately 500 million straws used in the U.S. each day account for 1.6 million pounds of CO2 emissions — 301,757.36 tons annually.
The good news is that there are lots of practical alternatives to the single-use plastic straw, including the nine options below.
Note: This post contains affiliate links, which helps fund our Recycling Directory, the most comprehensive in North America.
1. Reusable Plastic
Reusable plastic alternatives are probably not the best solution but are far superior to their single-use siblings. Remember Krazy Straws? Why not keep a couple at the office?
2. Acrylic
A step up, acrylic straws are the sort of straws that you find in the reusable cups sold at your local coffeehouse or donut shop. The acrylic is durable but can show some signs of wear from the dishwasher.
3. Glass
Elegant and sustainable, glass straws can up your fancy factor.
4. Metal
Metal straws + milkshakes = heaven. Photo: Adobe Stock
Like glass, aluminum or stainless steel straws can conduct temperature — but for ease and durability, metal is hard to beat. Plus, imagine drinking with a chilled, metal straw the way you would use a frosty mug.
5. Bamboo
Everyone knows about the renewability of bamboo as a resource, so why not capitalize on its strength and versatility to make a sustainable bamboo straw?
6. Plant-Based/Compostable
If single use is important, choose a plant-based product that will easily compost. Try a flavored, edible straw made from a seaweed-based material are on the way.
7. Paper
Proceeds from these turtle-themed straws benefit the Sea Turtle Care Center in South Carolina. Photo: Aardvark
Classic striped paper straws will add a touch a whimsy and vintage feel to your lemonade, but be warned, some can wilt. Aardvark was the official partner of Strawless in Seattle and is known for making stronger straws.
8. No Straw At All
This is our preferred approach. Is no straw a radical move or just, as Strawless Ocean claims, an effort to stop sucking?
Don’t Forget
Keep in mind that if you do choose a reusable straw, you must clean that straw because it is the perfect environment for all kinds of nasty things to grow. It’s not always an easy feat, but many of the companies that make the reusable straws also offer handy, skinny brushes for just that purpose.

Recycling Mystery: Propane Tanks,"Propane gas. You can use it to heat your house, grill up a weekend barbeque, or light a camp stove. Like a lot of other items in and around our homes, propane tanks require special care when it’s time to dispose of them.
The Problem
Propane gas is compressed into liquid form and housed in tanks of various sizes. Propane grill tanks weighing 20 pounds are the most common size. You’ve seen them stacked around someone’s outdoor grill — perhaps your own. At some point, those tanks will need to be disposed of responsibly.
Propane tank disposal presents one teensy problem. There may be flammable gas left inside an “empty” tank. That leftover gas renders propane tanks hazardous. Hazardous waste is defined by the EPA as “leftover household products that can catch fire, react, or explode under certain circumstances.”
This means you cannot throw your tanks in the trash (or recycling bin) when you’re are through with them. Doing so could harm the people collecting your trash.
So, what the heck do you do when it’s time to get rid of them?
Never fear — you have options.
Propane Tanks Are Designed for Reuse
Have you heard of those businesses where you can use the same container over and over again? Brands as large as Tropicana and Crest have created reusable and refillable packaging to cut down on single-use packaging waste. It looks like they may have taken a tip from propane sellers.
Propane grill tanks were designed from the get-go to be refillable.
This is how it works for a propane grill tank.

Buy a propane tank filled with gas from your local hardware, grocery, or drug store. The cost will include a deposit on the tank.
When your tank appears empty, disconnect it from your grill. (Be sure the gas is shut off.)
Bring the tank — remember it’s not fully emptied so use caution — to a retailer that accepts returns. Many retailers, such as Blue Rhino, will accept any brand of propane tank for reuse or recycling when you purchase one of theirs.
When you present your old tank, the deposit will be deducted from the purchase of a new tank.

You may not even have to exchange your tank. Hardware stores often refill tanks on the premises. Be aware that tanks need to be in reasonably good shape — without a lot of rust or dents — to be eligible for a refill. That’s a closed-loop system, as long as your tanks stay in good shape.
One of the best ways to minimize waste from propane tanks is to take care of them so they can be reused. If this grill tank had been covered, it might not have rusted.
How To Dispose of Propane Grill Tanks
Propane grill tanks all have a date stamped on them. In most cases, the tank is good for 12 years after that date. After that, it may be possible for a licensed propane dealer to recertify the tank. Unfortunately, recertifying a tank costs roughly $30 or $40, so many people opt to buy a new one.
Remember propane tanks cannot go in curbside recycling. But they can be brought back to various retailers for recycling. Hardware stores are a good bet. There may be a fee or retailers may offer tank recycling as part of a sale. Another option is to use the AmeriGas search tool to find a local propane retailer that accepts tanks for recycling. You can also search the Earth911 Recycling Database for a recycling solution near you — just enter your ZIP code.
If you didn’t buy a refillable propane canister for your camp stove, take the empty tank to your local household hazardous waste site for safe disposal.
How to Dispose of Camp Stove Cylinders
Depending on local and state regulations, you may be able to refill small, one-pound propane cylinders from your grill tank. To do this, you need an adapter. If you have any doubt that you can refill your cylinder safely, don’t try it. Safer options are available.
There is debate on whether empty cylinders can be thrown in the trash. Some sources say that you can run the tank out by attaching it to an appliance until it’s empty. Others say never to do this on your own, as you also have to puncture the cylinder to depressurize it.
A safer and much more sustainable alternative is to bring your empty camp stove gas cylinders to a household hazardous waste (HHW) collection site. They’re the experts. They can drain the gas out and recycle the container for scrap. To find a collection site near you, enter your ZIP code in Earth911’s Recycling Database and search for HHW.
With proper maintenance, your household propane tanks should last for years.
How Long Do Household Propane Tanks Last?
Propane tanks that are used to heat homes can run up to 500 pounds. Like an oil burner, they need to be serviced yearly. With proper maintenance, these tanks can last up to 30 years. Some scrap yards will buy or sell (empty) propane tanks for other uses. Tanks can be used in construction, as an art canvas, as a meat smoker, and more.
Keep Your Tanks in Good Shape
One of the best ways to minimize waste from propane tanks is to take care of the ones you already have. Cover up grill tanks to prevent rust. Use care when carrying portable tanks so they don’t get dented. Get your household tank serviced regularly. Take care of the stuff you own, and you’ll be helping take care of the planet.

Transform Grief Into Environmental Healing with Memorial Trees,"The loss of a beloved family member is one of the most challenging times humans face. There is no simple solution to process the deep emotional loss. However, we can find ways to manage the intense grief through a meaningful memorial, planting a tree in memory is another natural way to honor someone.
A Memorial Tree cleans the surrounding air and provides habitat for wildlife. It creates a legacy that helps protect local ecosystems and green spaces, inviting nature to play a role in our emotional and mental healing.
Choosing a Memorial Tree
Choosing a Memorial Tree is a simple yet significant process. It typically begins by choosing your preferred Memorial Forest, a dedicated area where your loved one’s ashes will be placed,  and tree species. Explore available trees online or schedule a free in-person tour with a guide who canhelp find the tree that fits your needs and budget. Then, people often visit the Memorial Forest to see their Memorial Tree in-person.
When it’s time, schedule a Forest Memorial service during which  cremation or aquamation ashes are returned to the earth at the base of your  Memorial Tree. Ashes are integrated with native forest soil at the memorial table. The ash and soil mixture is placed at the base of your tree, cradled by a nest of forest floor. Share readings, songs, memories – whatever feels right to you. After the earth has settled, forest guides place a custom-inscribed memorial marker at the base of your Memorial Tree.
Choosing a Memorial Tree over conventional methods of burial is a declaration of one’s  dedication to environmental stewardship. It’s a choice that reaps results with time as the tree grows. It symbolizes life, peace, and evidence of your love and affection for the soul you lost.
The Environmental Impact of Memorial Trees
Trees perform the vital task of absorbing carbon dioxide and exhaling life-sustaining oxygen. Opting for a Memorial Tree is, in essence, contributing to the purification of our air.
Beyond their role as air purifiers, memorial trees contribute to the wider forest ecosystem. They support birds, shelter insects, and offer sustenance to wildlife, creating a blend of life-affirming activity from a single act of remembrance. The roots anchor the soil, preventing erosion and preserving the land’s integrity against nature’s tempests.
In essence, the act of choosing a Memorial Tree weaves a narrative of life, legacy, and environmental consciousness, marking a path for future generations to be responsible and thoughtful about the earth and its greens. Your act of remembrance leaves a positive environmental legacy.
Comparing Environmental Impacts
While traditional burials allow for intimately marking a loved one’s resting place, they have a significant environmental toll. Cemeteries consume vast amounts of land that could support ecosystems.
The chemical fluids used to prepare the body, along with non-biodegradable caskets and concrete vaults, introduce harsh substances that contaminate the soil. In contrast, Memorial Trees are a 100% natural way to return to the earth. As living tributes, they purify the air, prevent erosion, create wildlife habitats, and leave a positive legacy aligned with nature’s cycles. Planting a Memorial Tree honors your loved one while giving back to the planet.
The American Planning Association estimates that about one acre of cemetery land is needed for every thousand people. As cities grow and change, cemeteries increasingly need to be moved. Imagine, instead, what we could do if all those cemeteries served as green spaces.
Cremation  is often considered more eco-responsible than traditional burial, but it still carries an environmental cost. The cremation process uses fossil fuels, generating carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change. Mercury from dental work is also released into the atmosphere. Additionally, cremated remains contain environmental pollutants.
Memorial Trees can help offset carbon from cremation because they absorb CO2 as they grow.
Aquamation, or alkaline hydrolysis, is a “greener” alternative to cremation and traditional burials. The process involves the use of an alkali solution rather than fire. Nevertheless, it still generates emissions and produces chemical byproducts that require special disposal. It is possible to spread aquamation remains around a Memorial Tree.
Taking Steps Forward, Growing A Future For Humans & Wildlife
The weight of grief can feel unbearable, leaving us searching for healing. Thinking of a living Memorial Tree offers a meaningful path forward, blending the intimate ritual of honoring a loved one with positive action for the planet. And a Memorial Forest is a healing place which to return to and remember those you lost.
Planting ritual mirrors the nurturing you provided your loved one. As seasons pass, watching the tree’s cycles brings you peace. Your grief is transformed into an offering of environmental restoration.

Guest Perspective: Embracing the Circular Economy Means Transforming Food Packaging for a Sustainable Future,"Embracing the circular economy is vitally important for all industries, especially in the context of food packaging. Using food packaging that helps create a circular economy can transform the food packaging industry into a more sustainable and efficient system.
Although there can be many challenges when implementing more sustainable packaging, there are now innovative materials that the food packaging industry is using to revolutionize sustainable practices and embrace the circular economy. While adopting new technology will always involve some investment, the key benefits of investing in a circular economy are the long-term economic benefit and the potential for real cost savings through the entire supply chain. Benefits include:

Reduced resource consumption: Designing products that last longer and are recyclable leads to cost savings as materials and components can be reused instead of purchasing new ones.
Reduced waste disposal cost: Circular economy practices minimize the amount of waste, which means savings on waste disposal costs and potentially additional revenue if recycled materials can be sold.
Enhanced brand reputation: There is an increasing demand for sustainable products, so embracing the circular economy can enhance brand reputation and attract new environmentally conscious customers.

The current lack of recycling initiatives is a key barrier to adopting a circular economy. However, embracing this model can overcome this challenge and simultaneously create new, local career and entrepreneurial opportunities in recycling. This approach addresses the initial hurdle and leverages it as a stepping stone towards innovation and sustainable practices.
Another challenge has traditionally been a lack of consumer awareness of sustainable food packaging. However, this is changing rapidly, with many consumers aware of the environmental impact of packaging materials and the benefits of choosing more sustainable options. To fully embrace the circular economy, there will be much collaboration required among various stakeholders to introduce and implement effective, sustainable strategies such as the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) program.
A sustainable future is possible if we address the existing challenges, explore innovative materials, and implement a circular food packaging system.
Innovation Required
Truly achieving a sustainable future requires more than acknowledging current challenges; it demands a multifaceted approach that encompasses the exploration of innovative materials and the adoption of a circular food packaging system. This holistic strategy extends beyond the establishment of recycling infrastructure, which is crucial but insufficient.
For real transformation to take place, we must prioritize designing packaging materials that are inherently recyclable or compostable. This shift necessitates a reimagining of product life cycles, ensuring that materials can be easily returned to the earth or repurposed into new products without environmental degradation.
Developing incentive programs is critical for encouraging both businesses and consumers to participate actively in recycling efforts. These programs can vary from financial rewards for returning packaging to discounts for choosing sustainable options, fostering a culture of responsibility and environmental stewardship.
Lastly, the emphasis on local solutions is pivotal in minimizing transportation impacts, one of the often overlooked aspects of packaging sustainability. By localizing the production and recycling of food packaging, we can significantly reduce the carbon footprint associated with transportation, making the journey toward sustainability more achievable and impactful.
Together, these elements—designing for recyclability and compostability, incentive programs, and local solutions—form the backbone of a circular food packaging system that addresses the immediate challenges and paves the way for a truly sustainable future.
The Crucial Role of Circular Economy in Modern Food Packaging 
As with any industry, food packagers must balance economics, convenience, and sustainability. The circular economy offers solutions to these challenges.
In the food packaging industry, achieving a balance between economics, convenience, and sustainability is paramount. The circular economy framework presents viable solutions to these challenges, notably by reducing the ‘green premium’—the additional cost often associated with sustainable practices.
While skepticism remains regarding the expansion of recycling options due to observed pullbacks in brand support for collection programs, the potential for growth in this area cannot be dismissed outright. Increased recycling capabilities and innovations in packaging design could enhance the availability of sustainable options, decreasing the green premium over time.
Currently, single-use plastic food packaging significantly impacts the environment, with 84% of plastic waste sent to landfills in Australia. As with all sustainable alternatives, increasing consumer awareness is a crucial factor. Although shoppers understand that some materials have a negative environmental impact, educating them about the benefits of sustainable options can increase demand and encourage investment in developing more innovative sustainable packaging materials.
Addressing food waste is crucial for resource efficiency and sustainability. Food waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and represents a loss of resources and money. Innovative solutions, like intelligent packaging and surplus food apps, can reduce waste and create more efficient packaging and distribution systems.
Embracing a holistic approach to food packaging demands comprehensive consideration of the packaging’s entire life cycle—from material sourcing to disposal. Central to this strategy is the prioritization of renewable materials, which significantly reduces the ecological footprint of packaging. These materials, derived from sustainable sources, are designed to have minimal impact on the planet.
It is crucial to address food waste through innovative packaging solutions. Packaging that extends the shelf life of food or allows for easier portion control can significantly reduce the amount of food discarded. This not only conserves resources but also diminishes the environmental damage associated with food production and disposal.
The journey towards sustainability is further advanced by amplifying the roles of reuse and recycling within the industry. A shift towards packaging designed for multiple uses, or easily recycled, plays a crucial role in reducing landfill waste. By developing and implementing effective collection and processing systems, we can ensure that more packaging materials are reclaimed and repurposed.
Implementing these steps requires a collaborative effort across the entire supply chain—from material producers to consumers. By integrating renewable materials, minimizing food waste, and enhancing reuse and recycling efforts, the food packaging industry can significantly contribute to more sustainable and efficient resource use, effectively closing the loop in the packaging lifecycle.
Circular Design Principles: Reshaping the Landscape of Food Packaging 
Circular design principles are changing how we approach food packaging, including integrating various kinds of sustainable food packaging options. These innovative solutions range from using renewable materials to compostable and recyclable packaging options, reflecting a commitment to environmental stewardship. Embracing circular design can promote sustainable materials while minimizing waste and offering economic benefits.
The design process behind sustainable packaging is crucial as true re-usability is key for any effective circular design system. Whether a product that can be continuously reused or something made from material like recycled polyethylene (rPET), which can be continuously recycled without losing quality, Food packaging should always encourage reuse wherever possible. By adopting modern recyclable and reusable materials, the carbon footprint of the food packaging industry can be massively reduced, thereby promoting a more sustainable future.
Using sustainable materials and innovation in the production process is a large contributor to creating a circular economy. Embracing circular design is all about closing the loop through recycling and composting. This is essential for modern businesses and consumers to protect the environment and its resources.
Sustainable Packaging: How to Make the Right Choices
Currently, the best way for consumers to identify the sustainability of food packaging is through correct labeling. Manufacturers investing in research and development to produce sustainable packaging will label the packaging to reflect this as a selling point.
Identifying sustainable food packaging relies on understanding credible labels. Trustworthy certifications include the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for paper and the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) for compostable products. The recyclability of plastics can be determined by the resin identification code (RIC), though local recycling capabilities must also be considered. Consumers should be cautious of vague terms like “recyclable,” which lack standardization. Instead, focus on specific labels that indicate third-party verification, such as products certified by the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. Educating oneself on these labels can lead to more informed and sustainable choices.
Packaging certifications (such as BPI, FSC, and ISCC) and standard benchmarks can be good indicators of the environmental impact of certain food packaging. They can also be used to track the life cycle (known as start-of-life and end-of-life). These factors are used to analyze the total sustainability of a product and depend on the renewable nature of the materials, energy consumption used in production, carbon emissions, and recyclability or composability at its end-of-life.
Innovations Shaping Tomorrow: The Role of Technology in Circular Packaging
The drive toward sustainability in the packaging industry hinges on concrete innovations and the active participation of key players—namely, Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies, who stand as the primary innovators. These entities are pivotal in integrating new material technologies, enhancing recycling processes, and employing smart packaging solutions that push the industry toward a circular economy.
Sustainable materials are just the starting point. CPG companies must invest in bioplastics and other recyclable materials and ensure these alternatives are compatible with advanced recycling technologies. This involves a dual commitment to developing durable, recyclable, or compostable materials, reducing the reliance on virgin resources.
Smart packaging with QR codes and RFID tags offers more than just tracking capabilities. It’s about establishing a robust infrastructure that utilizes these technologies to manage the lifecycle of packaging. Innovators must work towards systems that leverage data from these tags to streamline recycling processes, reduce waste, and even guide consumer behavior towards sustainability.
In the realm of supply chain optimization, the implementation of AI and data analytics by CPG companies is crucial for minimizing environmental impact. This goes beyond reducing costs—it’s about enhancing efficiency at every stage, from raw material sourcing to product distribution, ensuring minimal waste and energy use.
Consumer engagement is another critical area. Innovators should not only focus on technological and material advancements but also on initiatives that encourage responsible consumer behavior. This includes clear labeling, education on recycling practices, and incentives for choosing sustainable options.
The key for readers looking to support sustainability is to identify and back brands that transparently demonstrate their commitment to these innovations. Look for products with clear sustainability certifications, participate in recycling programs, and favor companies that invest in smart packaging and supply chain improvements.

This goes beyond reducing costs—it’s about enhancing efficiency at every stage, from raw material sourcing to product distribution, ensuring minimal waste and energy use. Consumer engagement is another critical area. Innovators should not only focus on technological and material advancements but also on initiatives that encourage responsible consumer behavior. This includes clear labeling, education on recycling practices, and incentives for choosing sustainable options. The key for readers looking to support sustainability is to identify and back brands that transparently demonstrate their commitment to these innovations. Look for products with clear sustainability certifications, participate in recycling programs, and favor companies that invest in smart packaging and supply chain improvements.

Creating a Small Cold Frame Greenhouse from Reclaimed Wood,"Building a small cold frame greenhouse from reclaimed wood is a enjoyable and sustainable weekend project. Unlike some quick tutorials, this project requires time and dedication. Expect to spend a full day on this project. So, grab your favorite drink, sit back, and enjoy the process of learning and making.
For a step-by-step video tutorial on how to make your own cold frame greenhouse with reclaimed wood, check out our video tutorial on YouTube.

What You’ll Need
Prepare a variety of tools to streamline the construction process. Here’s what we used, but feel free to adapt based on what you have:

Planer/thicknesser
Table Saw
Miter Saw
Drill Press
Drill
Impact Driver
Metal Detector

Materials
We predominantly use reclaimed wood for our projects, but feel free to use any material of your choice. Here’s what we used:

Pallet Wood
Reclaimed Roof Trusses
Reclaimed Window, with intact glass
Chipboard Screws
A Piano Hinge

While stainless steel screws and hinges are ideal for outdoor projects like this, we worked with what we had due to COVID-19 restrictions at the time of making. Embracing constraints can inspire creativity.
Measurements For The Cold Frame Greenhouse

x Back Legs @ 110cm (43.31 inches) x 4.5cm (1.77 inches) x 3.5cm (1.38 inches)
2x Front Legs @ 99cm (38.98 inches) x 4.5cm (1.77 inches) x 3.5cm (1.38 inches)
6x Side Boards @ 54cm (21.26 inches) x 13cm (5.12 inches) x 2cm (0.79 inches)
6x Front And Back Boards @ 120cm (47.24 inches) x 13cm (5.12 inches) x 2cm (0.79 inches)
1x Backer For Hinge Attachment @ 120cm (47.24 inches) x 2.5cm (0.98 inches) x 2cm (0.79 inches)
1x Front Lip @ 120cm (47.24 inches) x 3.5cm (1.38 inches) x 2cm (0.79 inches)
3x Bottom Boards @ 120cm (47.24 inches) x 13cm (5.12 inches) x 2cm (0.79 inches)
2x Gap Fillers @ 109cm (42.91 inches) x 6cm (2.36 inches) x 2cm (0.79 inches)
2x Supports @ 80cm (31.50 inches) x 3.5cm (1.38 inches) x 2cm (0.79 inches)

Step-by-Step Instructions
Begin by running a metal detector over the reclaimed wood to remove any metal pieces.
Cut the roofing trusses to size for the legs using a table saw and miter saw. Plane the boards to tidy them up and ensure uniform thickness and straighten the board edges using a jointer sled on the table saw, then cut to final size.
Cut the side boards to length using the miter saw. Create a 10-degree angle along the length of two side boards for the top of the greenhouse.
Cut a 10-degree angle along the tops of the legs to accommodate the reclaimed window.
Mark and drill countersink holes on the boards for screws.
Fix the side boards to the legs, ensuring flush alignment and attach the back boards, then the front boards and front lip. Then, install the bottom boards, leaving even gaps for drainage.
Reinforce the bottom boards with brackets as needed and attach the backer for hinge attachment.
Finally, attach the reclaimed window to the backer using the piano hinge.
Why Do You Need a Cold Frame Greenhouse?
A small greenhouse, also known as a mini or micro greenhouse, is perfect for growing vegetable seedlings. Especially in times like these, it’s a smart way to reduce trips to the store and boost your immune system with fresh, home-grown produce.
The compact size of the greenhouse makes it suitable for even small spaces, and its waist height design ensures comfortable access without straining your back.
Happy gardening!

How To Quit Fast Fashion for Good,"The MO of “fast fashion” brands is to mass-produce trendy designs at a low cost. While some brands are working on a greener selection, we know that greenwashing, waste, and human rights violations abound in the fashion industry.
Emma Mathews, founder of the sustainable British sock brand Socko and author of How to Quit Fast Fashion: 100 Expert Tips for a Sustainable Wardrobe advised us on how to take meaningful steps towards quitting fast fashion.
Learn the True Cost of Fast Fashion
Clothing is more than the sum of its materials. Behind every garment are people, water, agriculture, energy, and transportation emissions, and much more.
The fashion industry produces more carbon emissions than international flights and maritime shipping combined, and is the second-largest consumer of the world’s water supply — despite this, 85% of all textiles end up in the dump each year.” –How to Quit Fast Fashion
In Mathews’ view, the hazards of fast fashion are greatest for textile and garment workers and the environment. “Clothes don’t magically appear. Think about the number of hands that handle that garment before it gets to you, about how much you pay versus what the person is paid — after retail and shipping costs — for something designed to be throwaway.”
Garment makers work in appalling conditions because retailers, to satisfy demand, prioritize low-cost clothing over people’s lives. One of the starkest examples is the 2013 Rana Plaza fire in Bangladesh, the fourth largest industrial disaster in history, during which 1,100 people died and another 2,500 were injured.
Reevaluating your relationship with fast fashion means reconciling with the environmental and human costs, but Mathews is adamant that preaching isn’t the goal. On the contrary, “it’s about providing tools so consumers can make the decision for themselves.”
Tips To Help You Quit Fast Fashion
Rethink Your Closet
“Even if we stopped production tomorrow, we have enough to clothe the next two generations,” says Mathews.
So, it’s not that we need more clothes — it’s that we’re bored with what we have.

Form a stronger bond with your wardrobe. As the fashion industry adage goes, “The most sustainable clothes are the ones you already own.” To this, Mathews adds, “The back of the wardrobe is almost like being in a landfill” — if you don’t wear those clothes, you’re only putting off the inevitable.
Dig around in the back of your drawers. If you can’t salvage that T-shirt, who can? Consider donations, clothing swaps, or giving your garments away — and be realistic. If you haven’t worn it in the last year or two, it may be time to say goodbye.
Flirt with the capsule wardrobe. Take a page from the minimalist playbook and consider paring down to a capsule wardrobe, an approach that favors essential clothing items that don’t go out of fashion, augmented by seasonal pieces. Which are your seasonless staples? What can you easily mix and match?

Enhance Your Existing Wardrobe
Lessening your clothing’s impact on our ecosystem doesn’t have to mean sacrificing style.

Old clothing favorites can take on new flair with the right jewelry, belts, shoes, bags, or glasses.
Exploring your family’s vintage collection or shopping secondhand are cost-friendly alternatives to fast fashion.
Cut, dye, tailor, taper, sew, paint … the possibilities are endless. Dying your old jeans requires a lot less water than what it takes to create a new pair.

Make Your Clothing Last
It’s in your hands as a consumer to take care of your clothing. Instead of buying new, learn fundamental preservation principles from “way back when.”

Don’t ignore the tags. Tags display how to wash, bleach, iron, and otherwise care for our clothes. If you’re not sure how to read clothing tags, check this guide.
Dive into YouTube. “People shouldn’t be daunted by material repair! With textiles, you can undo a stitch as if it was Control-Z,” says Mathews. You can learn everything from how to thread a needle to patching a hole within a few hours from YouTube videos. Plus, “once you know the rules, you can break them and go rogue.”
Forget the sewing machine. You can make successful repairs with hand techniques — and it may even be easier because you can move the material around more flexibly. Start with Mathews’ denim repair tutorial in the highlights of Socko’s Instagram. She’ll soon be launching her own holistic clothing repair course.

Shop With Sustainability in Mind
Paying a fair price for clothing does mean it will be more expensive, Mathews says. That’s why consumers have to make a mindset shift between wanting a quick pick-me-up and thinking for all seasons.

Shop sparingly. Set a goal of not shopping for just 30 days and work up. When you do shop, ask yourself what you really need. Don’t beat yourself up about past purchases: “If you love and wear an item day in and day out, then there’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
Research ethical certifications, including certifications of fair trade textiles and organic materials. Buy as local and fair as possible.
Make the change. “People are programmed to think cheap prices on the discount rack are the going rate.” While you may pay more for ethical brands that have a takeback scheme or go the extra mile to help you mend your purchase (for example, Socko includes a darning kit with every purchase), you’re investing in a piece that will last you a lifetime — and supporting the safety and livelihoods of garment workers.

Learn How Fashion Is Changing, And Support Brands Making Progress
Since this article was first published, a number of fashion brands have made commitments and even made some progress toward reducing waste, improving collection and recycling programs, and introducing more sustainable fibers, some that breakdown in the environment without leaving plastic residues. Shoppers have power, but if all we do is withhold our cash there may be no positive signals sent to help those brands build awareness about sustainable alternatives.
Here are a few of our recent Sustainability In Your Ear interviews with fashion leaders:

Earth911 Podcast: EVRNU’s Stacy Flynn On Creating Circular Fiber For Sustainable Fashion
Earth911 Podcast: EVRNU’s Stacy Flynn On Creating Circular Fiber For Sustainable Fashion
Best of Earth911 Podcast: Wearwell Cofounder Erin Houston Builds Circular Clothing Lifestyles
Best of Earth911 Podcast: Andrea Ferris on Making Polyester Biodegradable with CICLO
Earth911 Podcast: The Apparel Impact Institute’s Kurt Kipka Maps the Path to Sustainable Fashion
Best of Earth911 Podcast: SuperCircle Breaks the Textiles Logjam

Final Thoughts: Turn Away From Fast Fashion
What makes it onto the clothing racks represents a give and take between brands and consumers. Since our closets don’t exist in a vacuum, both have a vested interest in designing for a circular economy and wearing for the long term.
Mathews believes retailers should educate consumers about the longevity of their items, and that we need legislation to regulate the fashion industry and protect garment workers. Changing consumer preferences are already making a positive impact, but there’s no quick fix.
That’s why brands, as well as consumers, must continue probing the way clothing production and consumption are interlinked. “If you want to have a sustainable business and lifestyle, How can you justify against what the planet needs?”

That’s why brands, as well as consumers, must continue probing the way clothing production and consumption are interlinked. “If you want to have a sustainable business and lifestyle, How can you justify against what the planet needs?” Editor’s Note: This article was originally published on January 7, 2021, and most updated in March 2024.

Apps That Help You Belong To Your Local Natural World,"I’ve just moved to a new place in the country and want to avoid the mistake of thinking I own the natural world. It is a challenge to become a member of an ecosystem, but with many apps at our fingertips, we can now explore and understand the flora, fauna, and geological features of our surroundings with unprecedented ease. 
Digital tools offer us a window into the intricate web of life, reminding us that we belong to a place rather assuming that it belongs to us. But without insights into a place and its natural ways, we fail to exercise the choice to support biodiversity and preserve the state in which we found nature. By learning about the native and invasive species in our area, we can contribute to preserving the natural state of our environment, allowing it to evolve naturally rather than molding it to fit our needs.
In my case, many of the lessons I need to learn involve stopping habits learned over decades of lawncare and urban gardening. Preserving a largely wild places involves knowing when not to pull something that seems like a weed. However, choosing native flowers and plants has already become a thrilling experience, because the spectrum of local colors and the sequence of early, middle, and late-Summer blossoms and harvests from the garden have filled my calendar with dates I can anticipate eagerly. 
As you learn about your local ecosystem, it’s a great idea to create a calendar of upcoming events. Set dates for cleanups, judicious watering, expected blossomings, and produce harvests to encourage your continued participation in the life of the place you live.
Flora: Unveiling the Green World
PictureThis and Plantum are botanical guides, helping you identify and learn about the plants in your vicinity. 
PictureThis is my go-to app for detailed information about plant species, including their characteristics and care tips. You just point your camera lens at a tree, shrub, or ground cover to get a quick identification and complete guide to caring for or, if it is an invasive species, the need to remove it. In my case, I found two invasive species, Himalayan Blackberry and Sweet Violet, both firmly established, that will require extensive attention over the next couple of years to eradicate completely.
Plantum also offers insights into plant health and growth conditions to foster a deeper understanding of the plant life that thrives alongside us.
PictureThis identified Sweet Violet as an invasive species of ground cover in Oregon. The app provides a complete explanation of plants, trees, and other flora, along with tools to plan garden care calendars.
Fauna: Discovering Animal Neighbors
iNaturalist and Seek by iNaturalist are comprehensive tools for exploring your local wildlife. iNaturalist allows you to record and share observations about animals, submissions through these apps contribute to a global database that aids scientific research. Seek also offers a more interactive experience, enabling identification of wildlife in real time so you can learn about the species you encounter. 
Merlin Bird ID, Picture Bird, and Picture Insect specialize in the avian and insect worlds. Merlin Bird ID uses technology similar to music identification apps to help bird enthusiasts identify bird song so they can learn about different bird species. Picture Bird provides a similar service with an image-based approach. Picture Insect, meanwhile, dives into the realm of bugs, spiders, ants, and grubs, offering identification and information about these often overlooked but crucial creatures.
Picture Fish opens a window to the underwater world, helping users identify and understand various fish species, their habitats, and behaviors. Since I live on a river, this app will help me build my knowledge of aquatic ecosystems and the life they harbor. There’s a lot just under the surface of the water, more than the fish folks are used to pulling out of rivers and streams. 
Aquatic Life and Geological Features
SoilWeb goes beneath the surface, offering a glimpse into the world under our feet. This app provides detailed soil data, including type, composition, and suitability for different plant species, enriching your understanding of an ecosystem’s foundation. In my case, because I live in the Southern Cascades, volcanic rock, gravel, and soils dominate — Crater Lake’s predecessor, Mount Mazama, buried the region in ash 7,700 years ago. SoilWeb provides a layer-by layer look into what’s below my feet, along with annual rainfall and insights into how the soil drains.
Rock Identifier is a geology enthusiast’s companion, enabling identification and learning about different types of rock and geological formations. This app not only aids in understanding the natural history of a place but also fosters an appreciation for the slow, powerful forces that shape our planet.
SoilWeb is like an X-Ray for your soil, providing a layer-by-layer analysis of soils types, hydration, and other features of the land.
 
Taking Steps Based On Your New Knowledge
Once you have an inventory of animals, birds, bugs, fish, flowers, plants, and trees in your yard, you have the basis for making better choices when decorating or just keeping the place looking beautiful. Consider taking these steps:
Eliminate harmful insecticides and herbicides that contribute to collapsing pollinator populations. If you still have Roundup in the garage, dispose of its responsibly to avoid losing local bees and insects critical to the lifecycles of plants, animals, and people.
Focus on removing invasive plants to give local varieties the room to grow and propigate naturally. It’s okay to have exotics that do not spread uncontrollably, but take the time to pull and destroy invasives, whose seeds can spread on the wind, in animal fur, and through bird populations.
Participate in wildlife, bird, and fish counting efforts to help science more completely understand our world. The U.S. Forest Service, CitizenScience.gov, and National Geographic are good places to find projects that welcome citizen scientists.
And be sure to vote in local and national elections with an attentive eye to environmental and social policy designed to encourage sustainable practices.
Through the lens of these apps and by refining our naturalist knowledge, we learn not just to see but to understand and appreciate the tapestry of life to which we belong. Try these apps to quench your curiosity about the natural world and develop respect for the ecosystems we inhabit. 
Recognizing that we are part of a larger web of life encourages us to live more sustainably and responsibly, ensuring that our world’s natural diversity can be preserved for future generations. Sometimes, technology can be harnessed to reinforce the idea that we are custodians of our planet, not conquerors.

Tips for Snipping Spring Flowers Without Harming Your Plants,"As springtime flowers burst and bloom, it’s natural to want to bring some of their lovely color and sweet fragrance indoors. But is there a surefire way to snip spring flowers without harming your plants? Earth911 spoke with gardening expert Melinda Myers to find out how to cut fresh, long-lasting flowers from your garden while leaving the plants intact.
Editor’s note: We interviewed Melinda Myers and originally published this article in 2013. 
1. It’s all about timing
The best time to cut fresh flowers is early in the morning when plants are still full of dew and moisture. This simple step yields healthy cuttings that last longer in a vase, and it’s better for your plants too.
But if you plan to dry your flower cuttings, Myers suggests letting nature start the process by snipping fully bloomed flowers in the driest part of the day, such as late morning or early afternoon.
2. Bring the right tools
You’ll get the longest life from your fresh flowers (and prevent possible damage to your plants) if you come to the garden prepared. Myers heads outside with two basic tools: a sharp knife, pruners, or garden shears, and a bucket of water.
When it comes to your cutting implement, any sharp blade will do. Both pruners and garden shears provide a never-dull edge and a convenient, scissor-like shape that’s perfect for beginners. If you’re comfortable handling a knife, that works too.
“The benefit is that good, clean cut,” Myers explains. “What you don’t want to do is crush the stem.”
While snipping your flowers, place the cuttings in the bucket as you go. The sooner you get your flowers into water, the less likely they are to wilt prematurely.
3. Know where and when
To promote regrowth and avoid harming your plants, be sure to give new plants enough time to establish themselves before cutting flowers, Myers suggests. Annuals generally take about a month to establish, while perennials may not bloom fully until the following season.
Generally, if your plant is lush and full of flowers, it’s safe to start snipping some off. Stick to about a quarter or so of a plant’s blooms, and cut above a set of healthy leaves to stimulate regrowth and keep the base plant looking attractive even after the flower is removed, our expert says.
4. Combine garden tasks
“Deadheading” is a common garden task that involves snipping faded flowers to promote regrowth. To make the process seem like less of a chore, Myers suggests a more proactive method.
Her tip: Simply trim away larger flowers when they’re in full bloom. This promotes growth, reduces the need for deadheading after flowers fade, and leaves you with a lovely fresh-cut bouquet to enjoy.
“So, you’re actually, ‘live-heading,'” Myers says with a laugh. “It sounds kind of scary, but you’re removing the flowers, encouraging more blooms, and enjoying the beauty of those flowers inside.”
5. Care for your cuttings
After bringing your fresh flowers indoors, re-cut each stem at a 45-degree angle before arranging it in the vase of your choice. The internet is full of garden myths about why you should cut at an angle, but the real reason is much more straightforward.
“The reason for cutting on an angle is simply to prevent the stem from sealing to the bottom of the vase,” Myers explains. “If it’s flat, it’s not going to be able to absorb the water.”
That’s not the only eye-opening tip in Myers’ arsenal. To increase the life of her fresh-cut flowers, the gardening guru turns to a florist’s secret called the “hardening off” process — which is way less complicated than it sounds.
After arranging your flowers in warm water, simply place them in a cool, dark place (such as a basement, closet, or spare bedroom with closed curtains) for about 12 hours or overnight. This allows the flowers to acclimate to the indoor environment. The next day, they will be ready to enjoy anywhere in the house.
6. Don’t be afraid to experiment
When snipping fresh flowers, you may think of time-honored classics like daisies or roses first, but don’t be afraid to experiment with all the flowers and foliage your garden has to offer, our expert suggests.
“That’s really part of the excitement is just getting in, trying different things, and finding out what works,” she tells us. “The worst that can happen is they wilt early, and you don’t need to use that again.”
Beyond standard cuttings, Myers makes unique arrangements with more uncommon picks like lisianthus, snapdragons, daylilies, and even green leaves from her garden. Some picks wound up lasting 10 days or more, despite her initial uncertainty.
“A lot of the things that florists are buying and using, you can grow in your garden,” she says. “I’ve done a variety of things, and sometimes I pick flowers that will surprise me.”

Unlock Your Limited Garden Space With A DIY Reclaimed Wood Wall Garden,"This project is perfect for those who love gardening but are short on space. With just a few used wood pallets, you can create a vertical garden that’s functional and a beautiful addition to any outdoor space.
We’ll guide you through each step, ensuring you can follow along no matter your skill level. For a step-by-step video tutorial on how to make your own reclaimed wood garden trellis, check out our video tutorial on YouTube.

The Tools You Need
While you can embark on your woodworking journey using the tools you have available, here’s a list of tools we used to craft our clip-on pallet wood vertical garden:

Crow Bar
Pound Hammer
Jigsaw
Claw Hammer
Jointer Sled
Table Saw
Sliding Compound Miter Saw
Brad Nailer
Angle Grinder
Drill
Impact Driver

Materials
For this project, we used one wood pallet, which are often available locally. Reddit and social media are good places to start your search. You can ask a warehouse if they have any old pallets they are ready to throw out, contact a pallet company, or visit a lumber yard that handles reclaimed wood.
You’ll also need:

Waterproof Wood Glue
38mm 18 Gauge Brad Nails
40 Grit Sanding Disc
Pair Of Steel Hooks
4x 40mm Chipboard Screws

And, approximately two hours to complete the project, though this may vary based on skill level and available tools and materials.
Vertical Garden Specifications
The design and layout of your vertical garden will depend on the type of pallet used. Elaine Parry has shared a variety of ideas on Pinterest. Get creative and plan a layout that suits your needs and taste. Determine the layout/pattern for the pallet you have and take measurements accordingly for the strips you wish to use.
Step-by-Step Process

Remove the two narrow boards from the pallet using a crow bar and pound hammer.
Extract nails using a claw hammer.
Use a jigsaw to cut out half of the central board, ensuring a straight cut with a speed square.
Straighten the edges of the boards using a jointer sled and table saw.
Cut the boards into appropriate sizes using a fence and stop block on the miter saw.
Fix the strips onto the pallet with waterproof wood glue and brad nails.
Utilize an angle grinder to clean and smooth the wood surface.
Attach hooks to the back of the vertical garden, avoiding nails in the pallet blocks.
Drill pilot holes and secure the hooks with screws using an impact driver.
Place the vertical garden onto a vibracrete wall, ensuring hooks sit securely.
Fill the garden with preferred plants, such as succulents or herbs, in suitable pots.
Allow the wood to weather naturally; no special treatment is necessary.
Water the plants using a watering can for easy irrigation.

Embrace the process and enjoy the results of your pallet wood vertical garden, adding a touch of greenery to your outdoor space. Enjoy the project!

Earth911 Special Video Event: How Saving Krill Could Help Save The Planet,"Tune in for an important conversation about the future of krill, the billions of tiny crustaceans that are a keystone in the food chain of the Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica. Overfishing of krill to make Omega-3 oil products also threatens a vital carbon sink that pulls planet-warming CO2 from the environment. This special video event features environmental journalist Ashlan Cousteau of EarthEcho International, Doug Heske, Dan Wheeler, and Matt Zimmer of Newday Impact Investing, Millicent Pitts CEO of Ocean Exchange, Monger.fish Founding Principal Aaron Niederhelman, Philipp Stratton, President and CEO of Ocean Power Technologies, environmental activist Melissa Walton, and Elizabeth Kim, director of the U.S. State Department’s Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs. 
Krill and many other species could be protected by introducing marine protected areas, or MPAs, regions of the Southern Ocean that will be set aside from commercial exploitation by a treaty currently under negotiation. But there are financial and political challenges on the path to protection. Get the story and learn what you can do to help.

Recycling Mystery: Mattresses,"Mattresses are one of those common household items that can be a huge recycling headache. Many thrift and secondhand stores don’t want them, and it can be tough to track down a recycling program that accepts them.
That said, sending your used mattress to the landfill can come with a hefty impact on the planet. An estimated 20 million mattresses are disposed of in the U.S. every year. A double mattress can take up as much as 60 cubic feet in a landfill (you can calculate the space your mattress will fill here) — making it that much more important to recycle your old one.
Despite the difficulties, mattresses can be recycled and donated. Four states have extended producer responsibility-based mattress recycling programs financed by fees added to your purchase: Oregon as of 2022, along with California, Rhode Island, and Connecticut since 2013.
Choose To Reuse
If your mattress is still in very good condition, it may be easiest to look for a new owner within your own social circles. Ask friends and family members if they know anyone who needs a mattress and offer up yours for free, or check with churches, homeless shelters, and community centers in your neighborhood. Perhaps a child going off to college could use it, as well.
If that doesn’t pan out, you may also be able to give your mattress away through Freecycle, BuyNothing, or sell it on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.
Still no luck? While many thrift stores don’t accept used mattresses for sanitary reasons, there are some options out there. Most Salvation Army stores accept used mattresses, and some will even pick up your mattress to save you the trouble of lugging it to your nearest branch. Also some St. Vincent de Paul locations accept used mattresses for reuse or recycling, but this may vary from region to region.
Be sure to call ahead first to avoid wasting a trip.
Opt for Recycling
If your mattress isn’t in good condition, recycling is likely your best bet. The wood, foam, cotton, and metal springs that make up most mattresses are all recyclable but finding the right recycler can be a challenge.
Some mattress stores will pick up your used mattress when dropping off a new one, but the fate of these mattresses is often a local landfill. Before opting for store pickup, ask a salesperson how the store disposes of used mattresses. Insist on recycling or take your business elsewhere — you have the power of the dollar to help the planet whenever you make a purchase.
If the store does not provide recycling, the manufacturer of your old mattress may offer a take-back recycling program. You should be able to find out through a quick call or web search, but if you strike out there, too, check for local recycling options by using Earth911 Recycling Search.
City-sponsored mattress recycling programs are also on the rise nationwide, and an increasing number of private specialty recyclers may also mean more options near you. So be sure to check with your local recycling program to see if they can provide guidance.

Recycling Mystery: Plastic Utensils,"Plastic utensils are not recyclable. If you’re considering buying any “disposable” with the intention of recycling it, it’s better to choose a reusable or compostable alternative. It’s time to move on from plastic utensils, plates, cups, and bowls — and in some nations, provinces, and states, single use plastics are being phased out through new bans on selling them.
But let’s assume for a minute that you have plastic utensils from take-out restaurants, office lunch parties or numerous other scenarios and want to keep them out of landfills. In theory, these utensils should be recyclable, but several issues likely prevent your local program from accepting them.
1. Inconsistent Materials
In a perfect world, all plastic utensils would be made from the same plastic resin, but that’s simply not the case. The majority of plastic utensils are made of polystyrene (#6 plastic), a plastic most commonly recognized in its expanded, foam form as Styrofoam. Other plastic utensils are made of PET (#1 plastic) or polypropylene (#5 plastic), which have a larger recycling market than polystyrene.
Unfortunately, individual utensils are typically not labelled with a plastic resin number, so you’ll have no way of knowing which plastic you have unless you can refer to the original packaging. Unless your curbside program says it accepts all plastics, leave them out of the recycling bin.
2. Unorthodox Shape
Plastic forks and knives can jam machinery in the MRF and are often considered a top source of contamination.
Materials recovery facilities (MRFs) are designed to take everything from your blue bin and sort it by material, then bale and send it off to a recycling company. Baling is much easier for materials that collapse, like aluminum cans, plastic bottles and newspaper.
3. The China Conundrum
Plastic utensils are classified as rigid plastics, just like clamshell packaging, blister packs and yogurt containers. Until 2018, most U.S. curbside programs exported scrap plastics, like utensils and cups, to China. However, China cracked down on the import of plastics, which changed rigid plastic recycling across the United States.
Replace Single-Use With Compostable and Reusable Alternatives
The easiest way to avoid seeking recycling solutions is to change your shopping habits. Look for compostable fiber-based utensils and tableware, or opt for reusable metal utensils and take the time to wash them instead of spending the time in search of recycling — besides they will perform better than plastic forks for your guests. Consider these alternatives.

Whether or not you can recycle plastic utensils will depend on your city, and there are lots of factors that limit the recycling market. If you’re buying plant-based cutlery thinking it can be composted, the jury is still out on whether these products actually break down even under the highest temperatures. Your best bet: Stick to reusable utensils.

Monitor Deforestation Policies To Make Your Shopping Earth-Responsible,"As calls for environmental preservation grow louder, deforestation is taking center stage. Last year, the European Union passed a law prohibiting the sale of products responsible for deforestation. However, a recent study by the nonprofit Ceres found that only 18 of 53 global companies have company-wide no-deforestation policies. Knowing more about the issue can help you make a positive difference.
Deforestation plays a pivotal role in reducing nature’s capacity to capture and use CO2, the planet-warming gas responsible for climate change. The depletion of rainforests, part of our planet’s respiratory system, threatens biodiversity, exacerbates climate change, and disrupts indigenous communities. It’s time to delve deep into the policies that can halt this relentless destruction.
Navigating Through the Maze of Deforestation Policies
Understanding the complex web of national and international deforestation policies is crucial for crafting effective and sustainable solutions. These regulations vary significantly across the globe, tailored to each region’s unique landscapes and challenges. Yet, their goal remains unified: to curb the rampant clearing of forests in the name of development and agriculture.
The cornerstone of any deforestation policy is sustainable forest management. This approach balances the need for economic growth with environmental preservation. It involves selective logging, reforestation efforts, and the protection of vital ecosystems. By implementing these strategies, we can ensure that forests thrive for generations.
The most important national and international deforestation policies and initiatives aim to address the complex drivers of deforestation and promote sustainable land use and forest conservation. Some of the policies and initiatives include:
Brazil’s Amazon Fund: Brazil has implemented several policies to curb deforestation in the Amazon, including the Amazon Fund, which supports conservation and sustainable development projects in the Amazon. The success of these policies in the early 2000s led to a significant reduction in deforestation rates, although challenges remain.
Indonesia’s Moratorium on New Palm Oil Plantation Licenses: Indonesia had placed a moratorium on new licenses for palm oil plantations to protect its rainforests and peatlands. However, the country rescinded the rule, allowing new palm oil permits to be issued starting in 2021. 
The REDD+ Mechanism: REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) is a United Nations-led initiative to combat climate change by incentivizing developing countries to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. REDD+ provides financial mechanisms for conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.
The Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use: Signed by 145 heads of state at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in 2021, this declaration aims to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. It was accompanied by commitments from the public and private sectors to provide significant financial support for forest conservation, making the companies’ actions an essential step toward success.
Corporate Commitments to Ending Deforestation
The Ceres Deforestation Scorecard 2023, published last November, evaluated 53 brands’ deforestation policies. The research reveals some important progress and many gaps that must be addressed to prevent the continued loss of forests.

A majority have partial policies, often limited to direct suppliers or specific regions, highlighting the need for more comprehensive approaches.
Only 18 companies boast clear, cross-commodity, no-deforestation policies, marking a step forward in corporate responsibility.
A mere four firms extend their no-deforestation commitments across all supply chains and regions, underlining the vast scope for improvement.
These findings emphasize corporations’ need to strengthen their policies, ensuring they cover all commodities, supply chains, and geographies to combat deforestation effectively.

From an impact perspective, the most important company on the list is Amazon, which has committed to avoiding selling products that contribute to deforestation, because the retailer accounts for 37.8% of online retail transactions. The 18 companies that have company-wide no-deforestation policies covering all relevant commodities, including soy, beef, palm oil, wood, cocoa, coffee, and rubber, are:

adidas AG
Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize NV
Amaggi
Amazon
Aramark Corp.
Archer-Daniels-Midland Company
Associated British Foods plc
Fromageries Bel SA
BRF Brasil Foods SA
Bunge Ltd.
Cargill Inc.
Carrefour SA
Casino Guichard Perrachon SA
CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.
COFCO Corp.
Colgate-Palmolive Company
Danone SA
Gap Inc.

A Global Call to Action
Deforestation is not just a local issue; it’s a global crisis that requires a unified response. International cooperation and the sharing of resources and knowledge are imperative. We can forge a path towards a more sustainable and forest-friendly future by standing together. Start by looking for companies with clear deforestation-prevention policies and when you can’t find a reliable option, write to companies asking for information and a commitment to prevent the destruction of forests.
The thread of deforestation policy weaves through the fabric of conscious shopping, presenting challenges and opportunities. It’s a complex issue but not insurmountable. We can tackle deforestation head-on through informed policies, technological innovation, community involvement, and corporate commitment. The time to act is now, for our planet’s health and future generations’ well-being depend on it. Let us commit to being part of the solution, ensuring that our forests—our planet’s lungs—remain vibrant and resilient.

How Youth Can Help Stop Plastic Pollution One Bottle Cap At A Time,"How can youth make its voice heard and create movements to preserve the environment? EcoTeens, a youth-led environmental organization, is working to raise awareness about the right way to recycle plastic bottle caps.
With a mission to enable youth to become active agents of environmental stewardship, Ecoteens inspires action through innovative campaigns, educational initiatives, and community engagement. The program is inspiring a new generation of eco-conscious leaders dedicated to making a difference.
You can help move the environmental conversation to action. EcoTeens is spearheading its flagship initiative called the Million Voices Campaign to address the pressing issue of plastic bottle caps and their detrimental impact on the environment. Let’s explore the goals of the campaign, the environmental concerns surrounding plastic bottle caps, and how individuals can take action to support this important cause.
The Problem: Plastic Bottle Caps and Environmental Impact
Plastic pollution is a global crisis and plastic bottle caps are a significant contributor. Billions of plastic bottle caps end up in landfills and oceans each year, posing serious threats to marine life and ecosystems. These caps are usually made of #5 plastic, which is recyclable, but also may be based on non-recyclable plastics, further exacerbating the environmental problem.
The Million Voices Campaign initiated by EcoTeens aims to raise awareness about the environmental consequences of plastic bottle caps and advocate for solutions to mitigate their impact. One key solution advocated by the campaign is keeping the cap on. We encourage consumers to leave the cap on their plastic bottles when recycling, which streamlines the process to ensure more plastic is recycled.
EcoTeens is leading the charge in driving change through grassroots organizing, advocacy efforts, and community outreach. Through educational campaigns, social media initiatives, and partnerships with like-minded organizations, EcoTeens is amplifying the message of the Million Voices Campaign and mobilizing youth worldwide to take action.
Taking Action: What You Can Do to Support the Campaign
Everyone can play a crucial role in supporting the Million Voices Campaign and combating plastic pollution. Here are some actionable steps you can take:

Leave the cap on plastic bottles when recycling to prevent them from becoming separated and lost in the recycling process.
Sign our petition calling for cap recycling participation across the nation.
Add your ZIP Code to this Earth911 Recycling Search to find local curbside and drop-off options for bottle caps.
Spread awareness about the environmental impact of plastic bottle caps by sharing information with friends, family, and on social media.
Support legislation and policies aimed at reducing single-use plastics and promoting sustainable alternatives.
Participate in local clean-up events to remove plastic pollution from beaches, rivers, and parks.

The Million Voices Campaign and EcoTeens rely on the power of youth activism in driving meaningful environmental change. By raising their voices and taking action, young people are demonstrating their commitment to protecting the planet for future generations. Together, we can make a difference and create a more sustainable world for all.

Can You Recycle Number 5 Plastics?,"Recycling isn’t the same as it used to be. A few years ago, China accepted much of the world’s plastic, textile, and paper recycling. But in 2018, China tightened restrictions on what it would accept due to the high level of contaminated material sent by the U.S.
Now, it’s time for the United States to take responsibility to recycle these streams of waste domestically in order to improve the “materials security” of the nation. That means keeping and processing more recyclable material inside the U.S., which will also reduce the carbon footprint of the current approach to recycling.
In the United States, plastic recycling is becoming a challenge, especially number 5 plastics. We’ve collected a few solutions to help you keep these plastics out of the landfills.
What Are Number 5 Plastics?
The recycling symbol on the bottom of a plastic product does not necessarily indicate that the item can be recycled. That number surrounded by chasing arrows is a resin identification code and tells users what kind of plastic they’re holding. The chasing arrows symbol does not mean the plastic will be accepted and recycled in your community.
The number 5 with the recycling symbol indicates polypropylene, often just shortened to PP.
The resin identification code for polypropylene, commonly known as number 5 plastic
This plastic type is particularly hard and heat resistant. It’s often used in prescription medicine bottles, yogurt cups, hummus tubs, single-use cutlery, and some packaging for personal care products like deodorant, lotion, or shampoo. Lids of single-use drink bottles are often also made of number 5 plastic as well as a great deal of single-use laboratory and medical supplies at hospitals, clinics, and labs.
Number 5 plastics were widely accepted in both curbside and drop-off recycling centers before China’s National Sword policy was introduced in 2018. That is when China stopped accepting contaminated plastic waste for recycling. Recently, Earth911 has seen more curbside and drop-off programs reintroducing #5 rigid plastic recycling, but films and bags remain a problem. Add your ZIP Code on the Earth911 Platform to find local options near you.
Recycling Mail-in Programs
Currently, there a few mail-in options for recycling polypropylene. Do check with your local solid waste district to check local options in your region before going to this effort and expense.
Matthew 25: Ministries
The international humanitarian aid and disaster relief organization Mathew 25: Ministries accepts clean, empty pill bottles. They welcome prescription medicine bottles as well as small pill bottles that may be too small to recycle curbside. The ministry reuses bottles in countries where such supplies are limited and recycle those they cannot use.

TerraCycle
The giant in recycling the hard-to-recycle arena is TerraCycle. This company’s motto is “eliminating the idea of waste” and they have programs that allow you to recycle almost any type of waste.
TerraCycle does not have a recycling program specifically for number 5 plastics, so you’ll have to hunt around their website for the best solution for the items you have. There are free recycling programs for a variety of home and personal care products, as well as fee-based which can be filled and mailed to TerraCycle for between $92 and $241for the smallest sizes. A few of the boxes are ideal for #5 plastics:
Zero Waste Boxes for dairy tubs and lids
Zero Waste Boxes for bottle caps
The All-in-One Zero Waste Box, for any material, including #5 plastics.
Keeping Number 5 Plastics Out of the Trash
We’ve experienced a plastics crisis in the United States and around the world. Do what you can to eliminate plastic waste. One good place to start is to avoid plastics, like polypropylene, that can’t be recycled in your normal curbside or drop-off location.
If possible, skip the plastic and buy your yogurt in bulk or in glass containers — or make your own! Order a three-month supply of medicine instead of one, cutting down on packaging while saving a trip to the pharmacy. 
Additionally, look for ways to reuse or upcycle your plastic containers. We love the idea of making suncatchers out of clear lids and playing a plastic bottle bowling game. Your number 5 plastic yogurt containers also make great organizers!
If your favorite product comes packaged in hard-to-recycle number 5 plastic, make your voice heard! Let the manufacturer know you love their product but want it to come in earth-friendly packaging.

Add your ZIP Code on the Earth911 Platform to find local options near you. Recycling Mail-in Programs Currently, there a few mail-in options for recycling polypropylene. Do check with your local solid waste district to check local options in your region before going to this effort and expense. Matthew 25: Ministries The international humanitarian aid and disaster relief organization Mathew 25: Ministries accepts clean, empty pill bottles. They welcome prescription medicine bottles as well as small pill bottles that may be too small to recycle curbside. The ministry reuses bottles in countries where such supplies are limited and recycle those they cannot use. TerraCycle The giant in recycling the hard-to-recycle arena is TerraCycle. This company’s motto is “eliminating the idea of waste” and they have programs that allow you to recycle almost any type of waste. TerraCycle does not have a recycling program specifically for number 5 plastics, so you’ll have to hunt around their website for the best solution for the items you have. There are free recycling programs for a variety of home and personal care products, as well as fee-based which can be filled and mailed to TerraCycle for between $92 and $241for the smallest sizes. A few of the boxes are ideal for #5 plastics: Zero Waste Boxes for dairy tubs and lids Zero Waste Boxes for bottle caps The All-in-One Zero Waste Box, for any material, including #5 plastics. Keeping Number 5 Plastics Out of the Trash We’ve experienced a plastics crisis in the United States and around the world. Do what you can to eliminate plastic waste. One good place to start is to avoid plastics, like polypropylene, that can’t be recycled in your normal curbside or drop-off location. If possible, skip the plastic and buy your yogurt in bulk or in glass containers — or make your own! Order a three-month supply of medicine instead of one, cutting down on packaging while saving a trip to the pharmacy. Additionally, look for ways to reuse or upcycle your plastic containers. We love the idea of making suncatchers out of clear lids and playing a plastic bottle bowling game. Your number 5 plastic yogurt containers also make great organizers! If your favorite product comes packaged in hard-to-recycle number 5 plastic, make your voice heard! Let the manufacturer know you love their product but want it to come in earth-friendly packaging.

Is Sustainable and Affordable Housing Feasible Amid the Global Housing Crisis?,"The world is facing a global housing crisis. If the status quo persists, there won’t be enough affordable homes for billions of people by 2030. Even the most powerful governments struggle to figure it out, so who can do something about it? You can.
Ordinary individuals play vital roles in helping address this basic need. Take a few minutes to understand what fuels the global housing crisis and how climate change exacerbates it. Then, you can see how to make housing more affordable and why sustainability matters.
Climate change intensifies weather events, which threaten the structural integrity and safety of the existing property stock. Vulnerable homes can succumb to ravaging storms, rising sea levels and fast-spreading wildfires. Global warming increases the need to modify construction standards to build climate-resilient homes.
What Drives the Housing Crisis?
Low inventory makes housing unaffordable in the United States. Experts estimate the nation needs up to five million more homes on the market to meet the demand. Interest rate hikes meant to discourage people from borrowing have fleeting effects. Ramping up construction is the long-term solution.
Canada’s housing unaffordability stems from the real estate boom of the 2000s. Back then, people speculated in residential units in hopes of raking in profits down the road. The Great White North’s immigration policy complicates the situation. The country can’t build enough homes for the number of foreigners it welcomes. The gap between supply and demand has worsened over time.

Real estate developers have caused a property downturn in China. These companies borrow capital from banks to buy land from local governments. Afterward, they presell units before completing them. They reinvest their earnings into more projects. However, overleveraged developers can’t keep up with payments. The Chinese government has intervened and restricted financing to companies in the red. It has resulted in mortgage defaults, partially finished buildings and disgruntled property owners.
Unlike its North American counterparts, China has surplus housing. Property prices are falling because demand has peaked. The problem is 78% of urban Chinese residents’ net worth is residential real estate. Plummeting property values eat into homeowners’ wealth.
How to Solve the Global Housing Crisis
No silver bullet can fix the global housing crisis, but you can do these four things to be part of the solution.
End Real Estate Speculation
Saying the world should stop looking at real estate as investable sounds crazy. It has been a time-tested wealth generator. However, treating homes as commodities incentivizes property owners to behave in ways that negatively affect housing affordability.
Real estate speculators acquire housing units to make a profit. These buyers tend to have deeper pockets and can generally outbid aspiring homeowners with fewer resources. Those who can’t buy end up as renters, helping landlords build equity on their units instead of generating wealth for themselves.
Suppose you can buy multiple properties. Purchase just your primary residence. Owning housing units you rarely occupy can lower inventory and drive up real estate prices. If everyone thinks this way, the world will only need to construct fewer homes to give everyone access to affordable housing.
Support the YIMBY Movement
Echo pro-development sentiments. Housing inventory won’t increase when people are against construction. The “yes in my backyard” movement counters the prevailing NIMBY attitudes of the few but influential wealthy property owners. They lobby against the addition of more local housing units for selfish reasons.
The YIMBY movement is the key to narrowing the gap between supply and demand. House depreciation shouldn’t be a big deal if home affordability is in everyone’s best interests. Mortgage borrowers are immune to it as long as they stay put and keep paying what they owe. Homebuyers benefit from it because they can take on less debt to afford a house and enjoy more manageable monthly payments.

Some YIMBY advocates say the market alone can solve the housing crisis as long as developers can build more freely in locations needing more homes. Libertarians will nod in agreement with this statement. Home affordability is more attainable with adequate public housing and can increase supply and variety. This way, buyers with various budgets and lifestyles can enjoy lower property prices and more options.
Make Your Home Net-Zero
A net-zero home generates the amount of electric power it consumes, among other low-emissions changes. It can be less costly to maintain and more climate-resilient than traditional houses.
Invest in a residential renewable energy system to drive demand for sustainable products. The more commercially viable they are, the more investors they can attract — and the cheaper they become.Going solar can shield you from power outages, which may happen more frequently when prolonged droughts become more common due to global warming.

If net-zero homes go mainstream, a location’s housing stock is unlikely to decrease, even if the effects of climate change go from bad to worse. A stable supply of homes matters to housing affordability.
Source Materials Locally
Using locally abundant materials helps keep construction costs low and also reduce the embodied carbon of homes and inspire greener building designs and practices.
Local sourcing can also shorten lead times. It helps complete residential development projects more quickly since localized supply chains are less susceptible to geopolitical events. Stakeholders can enjoy peace of mind when their orders arrive on time.
When planning your next home improvement, use a contractor working with local suppliers. It’s the first step toward making the construction industry more resilient to climate change, helping them build more and better with less time.
There’s No Time Like The Present For Sustainability 
Don’t let the global housing crisis go to waste. Use it as an opportunity to normalize practices promoting home affordability and sustainability. Take action in your community and share your achievements – send Earth911 your stories to help spur others to participate in the movement for access to housing.

Home Buying Risks From Climate Change,"Should you move to avoid climate-related extreme weather, drought, or disasters? There is certainly an argument to be made in favor of working to stop climate change wherever you live, rather than moving someplace where there are fewer climate risks. But you might not have a choice. Online tools can help you understand the climate risks where you live now, and research the risks in your prospective new home.
Despite the controversy surrounding the term “climate refugee,” people are already being displaced by weather-related disasters and long-term environmental degradation like desertification. By 2050, more than 200 million people are expected to migrate because of extreme weather or environmental degradation. Extreme weather and natural disasters can increasingly be definitively linked to climate change.
In 2020, more than half of the 30.7 million people displaced around the world were fleeing natural disasters. In 2022, some 3.2 million Americans were evacuated from their homes for some time due to natural disasters, with half a million of them still displaced as of the beginning of 2023. Real estate is not the indestructible investment it used to be.
If you are one of the 96% of Americans who lived through at least one extreme weather alert from the National Weather Service in the summer of 2023, you might be wondering if you could move someplace safer. In fact, in a recent Forbes Home survey, 30 percent of Americans cited climate change as one reason why they might move.
If your current home is at risk from sea-level rise or hurricanes, you might be considering moving to higher ground further inland. Almost no place is safe from wildfire smoke anymore, but many people in the West are currently living in high wildfire risk areas.
But you don’t want to move out of the fire zone and into the floodplain. Whether you are thinking about moving to climate haven or you are moving for more conventional reasons, climate risks like inland flooding or drought or both should take their place alongside considerations like school districts and views before you make a huge investment in a home you could live in for decades.
Online Tools
There are specific tools for identifying specific risks in your current or prospective home base. You can learn your tsunami zone or find your hurricane risk index score online. But several websites strive to be comprehensive.We also noted during our research that the more expensive the report offered by these sites, the more likely they were to characterize risks as more extreme.
A FEMA National Risk Index Report for Trail, Oregon. Enter your ZIP Code or address to see a local report. Source: https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/map
The federal government is an excellent source of free informatoon. In addition to hazard-specific resources, FEMA maintains an interactive map of the risk caused by 18 different types of hazards, from avalanches to wildfires. The National Risk Index map can generate reports by county or by census tract and generates scores for social vulnerability, which represents the susceptibility of an area to disproportionate impacts of natural hazards, and community resilience, the level of a community’s respond effectively to climate impacts relative to other communities at the same risk level. The FEMA information is free, and other sites provide similar data, as well as enhanced reports by address for a fee.
An Augurisk report for Trail, Oregon. Enter your ZIP Code for a local risk summary. Source: https://www.augurisk.com/Oregon/97541-Trail-OR-USA/42.6481115/-122.8068561
A new website called Augurisk generates reports by state, by county, by city, or by ZIP Code . Its reports are based on 12 types of risk with results divided into separate scores for natural disasters and societal risks. The natural disaster risk represents an average of the potential for storm events, coastal flooding, earthquakes and wildfires. It considers societal risks including air pollution, crime, and nuclear power plants. If you scroll to the bottom of county-scale reports, there is also a climate change forecast of predicted temperature changes through 2040.
RiskFactor.com, a project of First Street Foundation, provides many of the same risk assessments as Augurisk, but for a fee. The site is built on the same data sold to insurance companies, home inspectors, and governments. Home owners, sellers, and realtors can subscribe to access complete reports for $29.99 a month. RiskFactor.com described significantly higher risks of flooding, wildfire, and other climate-related impacts than either FEMA or Augurisk. For example, FEMA describes the risks in Trail Oregon for Heat Waves and Riverside Flooding as relatively moderate while RiskFactor scored Heat risk as Major and Flooding as Extreme, and Auguris .
Information Risk  
Because the resources include different data sets, they provide different risk scores for any given area. It’s a good reminder that you probably shouldn’t let AI tell you where to live. Color-coded numerical scores are easy to digest, but absent context, not very useful. For example, the city of Seattle, located on the shores of Puget Sound in Washington state, rarely receives snow. But it is located in King County, which has a very high score for avalanche risk, thanks to its mountainous rural areas.
AI-generated social risk measurements are potentially even more problematic. Taken too seriously, they could contribute to further segregation and environmental injustice in places where community building would be more appropriate. And even very geographically specific online reports are no substitute for a professional home inspection.
But if you take the time to dig into the full reports, AI-based tools can reveal the primary types of hazards facing a given area. And knowing those hazards might inform that home inspection and guide your search for disaster-resilient home construction. It can also help you budget and plan ahead for home resilience renovations.
Because no place is completely safe from climate change, no matter where you live, you should be prepared for natural disasters and start working to make your home and community more climate resilient. Making an informed decision is critical to having the lifestyle you desire, regardless of the associated risks.

Homesteading DIY: Building a Shed with Reclaimed Wood,"Looking to expand your storage space without splurging on a new shed? Consider making one from reclaimed wood. Not only is it sustainable, but it also adds rustic allure to your backyard. Follow our step-by-step guide to building a roomy shed from reclaimed materials.
Follow the steps we recorded when we were tasked with relocating a horse stable to a new site and repurposing the wood salvaged during the deconstruction into a spacious shed. For a walkthrough, check out our video documenting our reclaimed wood shed build on YouTube.

Reclaimed wood is available from a variety of sources, including Home Depot, local lumber dealers, from renovation projects (look for barn renovators to find a wide range of planks), and even online from Stikwood, Centennial Woods, Woody Walls, and Urban Wood Goods, among others.
Step 1: Design Your Shed
Sketch your shed’s size and shape, considering its purpose—be it storage, workspace, or else. Incorporate measurements into your design. If you’re at a loss for inspiration or drawing skills, designs are available for purchase and free online.
Step 2: Gather Your Supplies
First, collect the necessary materials and tools.

Reclaimed wood for framing and walls
Roofing materials (shingles or metal sheets)
Nails or screws
Saw
Hammer or drill
Level
Measuring tape
Safety glasses

Step 3: Prepare the Building Site
Clear debris and level the ground where you’ll build your shed, ensuring a stable base.
Step 4: Construct the Frame
Using reclaimed wood or, if you could not source used 2x4s or 4x4s, new lumber, start by building the shed frame. Cut and join pieces securely, ensuring level and square alignment.
Step 5: Erect the Walls
Attach reclaimed wood panels to the frame, leaving space for a door. If you need to learn how to frame a door, check this excellent wikiHow article.
Step 6: Install the Roof
Follow manufacturer instructions to install the roof using chosen materials. Ensure a secure, watertight fit.
Take the Next Step: Personalize Your Shed
Add final touches such as shelves, hooks, paint, or windows to customize your shed to your liking.
Crafting a spacious shed from reclaimed wood offers both sustainability and style, providing extra storage without breaking the bank. Follow these steps to create an environmentally-friendly, functional shed you’ll take pride in. Happy building!

Recycling Mystery: Flat-Screen TVs,"You’re ready to spring for a brand-new television, and now you’re faced with a problem. What do you do with your old flat-screen TV, whether it is based on LED, plasma, or LCD technology?
If it still works, the best option is to pass it along to someone who can use it. But if it is beyond repair, sending that giant TV to the landfill is not a good idea. TV screens and monitors contain chemicals and heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water. Plasma screens may be contain lead and the latest LCD screens still use small amounts of mercury — and lots of plastic encases all but the latest OLED TVs, which contain about 1/12th as much plastic as their predecessors.
Instead, recycling that old television is the right path to take. Let’s take a peek at some avenues for responsibly recycling your television. Read on to find out which option is best for you.
The Trouble with Trashing TVs
Worldwide, we humans generate over 63 million tons of e-waste every year. The UN Environment Program reports that only 17% of that waste is formally recycled. Unrecycled e-waste usually ends up in landfills or incinerators. Sometimes it ends up in developing countries that lack the facilities to handle these materials safely, endangering workers and the environment.
According to All Green Recycling, plasma TVs are one of the most frequently disposed consumer electronics items, but as newer technologies appear, they too are heading to landfills. Plasma, LED and LCD TVs contain heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury, lead, and copper, which are health risks to both humans and the environment.
In addition to the health risks, when we throw an old TV in the trash, we waste natural resources. Televisions house some valuable materials. It’s estimated that one ton of e-waste contains 100 times more gold than one ton of gold ore. (Anyone else wonder why we continue mining for gold if it’s just sitting in our landfills?)
Obstacles to Recycling TVs
We wish we could say that you can put your television out with your curbside recycling and call it a day. It’s not that simple.
Several obstacles make recycling LED and plasma televisions difficult:

Availability of electronic recycling facilities
Health and safety issues of e-waste recycling
Cost of recycling televisions
Transporting televisions/accessibility for consumers

Despite the rise of e-waste legislation requiring that TVs be recycled in half of the United States, consumers still have to do some leg work to get past these obstacles. Some retailers and manufacturers offer solutions that make it easier, thanks, in part, to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The EPA Challenge to Electronics Manufacturers and Retailers
Back in 2012, the EPA issued a challenge to electronics manufacturers, brand owners, and retailers. The Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) Electronics Challenge encouraged these entities to:

Increase their rates of recovering used electronics from consumers, businesses, and their own companies.
Send 100% of their used electronics to third-party certified e-waste recyclers.
Share their recycling data with the public.

Many companies took up the challenge, including:
LG, which offers a limited number of drop-off locations.
Samsung, which provides drop-off and a take-back program.
Sony partners with EIR Direct to provide a limited national network of drop-off locations.
Panasonic, which directs you to a variety of state recycling information sites in a confusing experience.
Hisense partners with MRM Recycling to provide a few drop-off options.
Vizio also partners with EIR Direct on a small network of drop-off locations.
Toshiba points visitors to its TV recycling page to MRM Recycling, which has a small number of drop-off sites.
In the Hall of Shame, Philips talks on its recycling page about the circular economy, but offers no link to actually recycle its products.
Finding a Retail Location That Accepts Flat Screen TVs as Trade-Ins or for Recycling
Some retailers will take your old TV for recycling when you purchase a new one, though there is often a fee. For example, Best Buy charges $29.99 for this service.
Do Curbside Recyclers Take Plasma, LED, or LCD TVs?
Curbside recycling programs, in most cases, accept paper, plastics, metals, and glass, but not electronics. Electronics recycling requires specialized equipment and safety precautions that curbside recyclers just don’t have.
Some curbside recyclers or municipalities may accept your TV for a fee. They will pick up and send your TV to an electronics recycler. Expect to pay somewhere between $25 and $40 depending on the size of your television.
Another option is to wait for an e-recycling event nearby. These are often hosted by local departments of public works, boards of health, or as fundraisers for community organizations.
Work With E-cyclers That Ethically Recycle Electronics
As if the whole process isn’t difficult enough, we do have a word of caution when attempting to have your television recycled properly.
Much of the e-waste in the U.S (and other developed countries) gets exported to developing countries. There, e-waste recycling workers are exposed to unsafe materials and practices that negatively affect their health. Unsafe recycling practices impact the local environment as well.
Fortunately, you can find reputable electronics recycling facilities by looking for one of two certifications. The EPA recommends that e-waste recyclers get certified through the Responsible Recycling (R2) Standard for Electronics Recyclers or the e-stewards standard. E-waste recyclers with these certifications commit to refurbishing electronics, if possible, and to using methods that safely and efficiently recycle electronic components for reuse.
Recycling E-waste Isn’t Easy, But It’s Worth the Effort
It’s not a simple task to recycle your old flat screen TV responsibly. But, when you care about environmental and human health and not wasting resources, it’s an easy decision.

A Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Reclaimed Wood Indoor Planter Box,"Bringing nature indoors with a planter box made from previously used materials is an excellent way to add a touch of greenery to your home while reducing your environmental impact. In this article, we will walk you through the process of creating your own planter box using reclaimed wood, a sustainable and cost-effective material.
Gathering Materials
Before you begin building your planter box, it is important to gather all the necessary materials. Here is a list of what you will need:

Reclaimed wood: Pallets, old floorboards, or any other type of reclaimed wood will work well for this project.
Plastic planter troughs or trays: These will keep your soil contained and prevent it from spilling onto the floor.
Planer or thicknesser: This tool will help you ensure that the wood is uniform in thickness and size.
Dowels and glue: These will be used to join the wood pieces together.
Screwdriver or drill: You will need a screwdriver or drill to attach the legs and shelf to the planter box.
Metal detector: This tool will help you remove any nails or screws that may be embedded in the reclaimed wood.
Paint or stain: This will give your planter box a finished look.
Paintbrush or roller: These will be used to apply the paint or stain.



Preparing the Wood
Once you have gathered your materials, it is time to prepare the wood. Start by taking apart the pallets or floorboards and removing any nails or screws. Use a metal detector to scan the wood for any hidden metal objects. If you find any, carefully remove them with a hammer, ply bar and pliers. Then, use a planer or thicknesser to dimension the wood pieces to the desired thickness.
Building the Planter Box
Now it is time to start building the planter box. Lay out the wood pieces on a flat surface and use dowels and glue to join the wood pieces together. Make sure that the joints are tight and secure.
The planter box featured in our tutorial video measures 103.5cm (40.75 inches) in length, 22cm (8.6 inches) in width, and 16cm (6.2 inches) in height, with the total height including legs reaching 80cm (34.5 inches).
Once the planter box is assembled, you can add the plastic planter troughs or trays. These will help to prevent the soil from spilling onto the floor, and they will also provide drainage holes.
Adding Legs and a Shelf
To add support and stability to your planter box, you can attach legs and a shelf. For the legs, we used slender 4×4 battens that we cut down the middle on a table saw. Secure the legs to the planter box with glue and screws.
For the shelf, you can use the same material as the legs. Cut the slats to the desired length and attach them to the base of the legs with glue and a brad nailer.
Finishing Touches
Once the planter box is assembled, you can add any finishing touches that you like. You can paint the planter box with a colour of your choice, or you can stain it to bring out the natural beauty of the wood.
We recommend using a paint or stain that is made from natural ingredients, such as milk paint or wood stain. These products are environmentally benign and will not harm your plants.
Embracing Imperfections
As you are building your planter box, you may encounter some imperfections in the wood. Don’t worry about these! Embrace the imperfections, as they will add character and uniqueness to your planter box.
Tips for Success
Here are a few tips to help you create a successful planter box:

Use high-quality reclaimed wood that is free of nails, screws, or other debris.
Take your time and ensure that all the joints are tight and secure.
If you are using stain, apply a few thin coats to avoid drips and runs.
Allow the paint or stain to dry completely before adding plants.

Enjoy Your Reclaimed Wood Planter Box
Once your planter box is finished, you can add your favourite plants and flowers. Your planter box will not only add a touch of greenery to your home, but it will also help you to reduce your environmental impact by reusing materials that have been discarded.
Creating an planter box is a rewarding and enjoyable project. By following these steps and using reclaimed wood, you can create a beautiful and sustainable piece of furniture that will bring life to your home.

  We Earthlings: Use Reusable Bags Wisely 
  Recycling Mystery: Flat-Screen TVs","Bringing nature indoors with a planter box made from previously used materials is an excellent way to add a touch of greenery to your home while reducing your environmental impact. In this article, we will walk you through the process of creating your own planter box using reclaimed wood, a sustainable and cost-effective material. Gathering Materials Before you begin building your planter box, it is important to gather all the necessary materials. Here is a list of what you will need: Reclaimed wood: Pallets, old floorboards, or any other type of reclaimed wood will work well for this project. Plastic planter troughs or trays: These will keep your soil contained and prevent it from spilling onto the floor. Planer or thicknesser: This tool will help you ensure that the wood is uniform in thickness and size. Dowels and glue: These will be used to join the wood pieces together. Screwdriver or drill: You will need a screwdriver or drill to attach the legs and shelf to the planter box. Metal detector: This tool will help you remove any nails or screws that may be embedded in the reclaimed wood. Paint or stain: This will give your planter box a finished look. Paintbrush or roller: These will be used to apply the paint or stain. Preparing the Wood Once you have gathered your materials, it is time to prepare the wood. Start by taking apart the pallets or floorboards and removing any nails or screws. Use a metal detector to scan the wood for any hidden metal objects. If you find any, carefully remove them with a hammer, ply bar and pliers. Then, use a planer or thicknesser to dimension the wood pieces to the desired thickness. Building the Planter Box Now it is time to start building the planter box. Lay out the wood pieces on a flat surface and use dowels and glue to join the wood pieces together. Make sure that the joints are tight and secure. The planter box featured in our tutorial video measures 103.5cm (40.75 inches) in length, 22cm (8.6 inches) in width, and 16cm (6.2 inches) in height, with the total height including legs reaching 80cm (34.5 inches). Once the planter box is assembled, you can add the plastic planter troughs or trays. These will help to prevent the soil from spilling onto the floor, and they will also provide drainage holes. Adding Legs and a Shelf To add support and stability to your planter box, you can attach legs and a shelf. For the legs, we used slender 4×4 battens that we cut down the middle on a table saw. Secure the legs to the planter box with glue and screws. For the shelf, you can use the same material as the legs. Cut the slats to the desired length and attach them to the base of the legs with glue and a brad nailer. Finishing Touches Once the planter box is assembled, you can add any finishing touches that you like. You can paint the planter box with a colour of your choice, or you can stain it to bring out the natural beauty of the wood. We recommend using a paint or stain that is made from natural ingredients, such as milk paint or wood stain. These products are environmentally benign and will not harm your plants.

We Earthlings: Use Reusable Bags Wisely,"A reusable cotton shopping bag can be a salve for environmental guilt, but a collection of them can be a carbon emissions and water use disaster. According to various research, it takes about 150 uses to offset the embodied carbon footprint of a cotton bag. When you account for water use and other environmental impacts, researchers in Denmark and Britain estimate a bag must be used 7,100 times to be considered environmentally neutral; surprisingly, organic cotton bags do even worse because organic cotton produces lower yields and would require 20,000 uses to break even.

Recycling Mystery: Vapes and Vaping Products,"When e-cigarettes, or vapes, came on the market in 2007, they were initially seen as 1) a healthier alternative to smoking tobacco cigarettes and 2) a possible stepping stone to quitting smoking once and for all. Unfortunately, the use of vapes has proven to have many health risks.
Vaping has increased dramatically since they were introduced over a decade ago. The CDC reports that over 25% of high school students used e-cigarettes in 2019. Their report also states that in 2020 over 17 million units of e-cigarettes were sold in retail stores over a four-week period — including marijuana vapes. This translates into hundreds of millions of vaping products added to the waste stream every year.
Some people originally thought vapes would be an environmental boon, since people wouldn’t be tossing cigarette butts on the ground. But vaping presents its own environmental problems including toxic chemicals, increased plastic, and electronic waste.
Components of a Vape
Most vape products include:



A cartridge that holds the e-liquid
E-liquid containing propylene glycol, flavoring, and nicotine or THC
An atomizer that heats the liquid
A microprocessor
A rechargeable battery (usually lithium-ion)
A sensor




An LED light
A mouthpiece that activates the device when the user inhales

All those components together make safe disposal complicated.
Mixed Materials Mean a Recycling Headache
Vapes are made of a mix of materials — usually a combination of glass, metal, and plastic. This combination makes it difficult to separate out any single material that might be recyclable. For this reason alone, vaping products are not accepted in curbside recycling.
What’s in That E-Liquid?
The liquid in e-cigarettes contains nicotine and a host of other chemicals. Marijuana vapes contain sticky THC oil, which makes recycling nearly impossible. Chemicals in e-liquid ingredients vary widely among manufacturers and regulation of these ingredients is lacking.
The EPA considers nicotine an acute hazardous waste material. Nicotine can be poisonous to children, pets, and wildlife. If discarded as litter, the nicotine can contaminate water systems. Don’t dispose of e-liquid in your garbage or recycling bin and never rinse it down the drain.
Vaping and Electronic Waste
The electronics in vapes also pose a recycling problem. Theoretically, you could separate the electronic components and bring them to a facility that accepts e-waste. Yet in these small devices, electronic parts such as coils and sensors are mixed in with plastic and glass. It’s difficult and sometimes impossible to separate them out for recycling. Disassembling a vape also poses the risk of spilling the e-liquid.
Lithium-ion batteries are a bigger problem. They are classified as hazardous waste and need to be handled properly. Under certain conditions, lithium-ion batteries can catch fire or explode. Improper disposal of batters can harm consumers and sanitation workers.
Confusion Around Vape Disposal
Like so many hard-to-recycle items, there is little guidance from manufacturers or the government for how to responsibly dispose of vaping products.
Not surprisingly, people who use vaping products are quite confused about proper disposal. The Truth Initiative asked a group of 15- to 24-year-olds how they disposed of vape products. Over 50% of respondents reported putting empty vapes either in the trash or in curbside recycling. A majority cited lack of clarity and convenience as barriers to proper disposal.
Recycling Options
There aren’t many options for recycling vapes. A few sellers of vaping products offer free products in exchange for vapes or cartridges returned for recycling. Sauce, a vape product company, for example, offers drop-off boxes at cannabis dispensaries. HEETS, VEEV, and VEEBA vaping products can be recycled through a free program managed by Terracycle.
Another option for at least turning in vapes is through the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). The DEA hosts prescription drug take-back events to prevent prescription drug abuse. In 2020, they added vapes and cartridges to the list of materials they accept. The program does not accept lithium-ion batteries.
Search Earth911’s recycling database to find a recycling location for lithium-ion batteries near you — just enter your ZIP code.
FDA Advice on Vape Disposal
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has declared that e-cigarette waste and e-liquid waste should be handled as household hazardous waste (HHW), but the Environmental Protection Agency has ruled vape products are exempt from household hazardous waste guidelines. The FDA offers the following guidance:

Check with state and local resources for regulations and hazardous waste collection sites.
Seal used vapes and keep no longer than 90 days before disposal.
Do not rinse e-liquid from cartridges — it will contaminate water.
Avoid getting e-liquid on skin, as it can be toxic.
Keep vapes away from kids and pets — the nicotine can be poisonous.

Find a location for HHW disposal near you.
Use Your Voice To Request a Solution
Ultimately, the onus of proper vape disposal falls on the consumer. What can you do? If your favorite brand doesn’t offer a takeback program for recycling their spent vape products, ask the company to provide one. You can also start a petition or contact your city and state representatives and tell them you support extended producer responsibility laws that require manufacturers to support recycling the products they make at their end of life. Your voice may help make a difference.

The Basics of Recycling Scrap Metal for Money,"Most of us know the value of recycling and reusing items like plastic bottles, hand-me-down clothing, and newspapers. Through reuse and recycling, we can reduce what goes to the landfill, reduce waste, and save on energy used to produce new materials. But is just as important, is scrap metal recycling.
By recycling metals, we reuse a valuable and finite resource and reduce the amount of ore mining throughout the world. Some of these metals include copper, steel, aluminum, brass, and iron. Unfortunately, these materials often end up in the garbage due to the lack of knowledge and sources for metal recycling. Learn about the opportunity to bring your unused metal items to the right place for recycling — and make some cash, too.

Recycling Scrap Metal Makes Money
Scrap metal can be recycled for cash payments at local scrap yards around the country, keeping this useful material out of landfills. By bringing your metal scrap to scrap yards, you can make money and recycle the materials at the right place.

A Magnet Assesses Metal Value
Determining if you have a ferrous or non-ferrous metal and separating the two types is the first important step before bringing metal to be recycled.
The easiest and most common way to figure out what kind of metal you have is by grabbing a magnet. Hint: Any magnet will do — even one from your fridge. 
If the magnet sticks to your metal: You have a ferrous metal in your hands — something common like steel or iron. Ferrous metal is not worth very much when you bring it to the scrap yard, but the scrap yard will accept it and make sure it is recycled properly.
If the magnet does not stick to your metal: The metal you have is a non-ferrous metal. Many common metals — like copper, aluminum, brass, stainless steel, and bronze — are categorized as non-ferrous metals. These metals are very valuable to recycle and are worth more money at the scrap yard.
Once you have your metals separated, search for a local scrap yard and call to see what metals they accept. Make sure you ask about their procedures and requirements so you know before you go. Oftentimes, homeowners feel intimidated going to a scrap yard. By calling ahead for information and making sure you have your metals separated to the best of your ability, you can proceed with confidence. Some scrap yards will require you to pull up to their doors and unload your metal onto their scale; others may have someone to take it out for you.
It Helps to Know Your Metals
The most challenging part of metal recycling is recognizing what material you are looking at and its value. Know these basic metals and it gets a whole lot easier.
Copper – $$$$
Copper is a reddish color if it is in good condition. If it is a bit worn, it can have a darker brown color with some green rusted areas.
Find a location to recycle copper near you, using the Earth911 Recycling Search — just enter your ZIP code.
Copper is a common material in your home. You may find it as plumbing pipes, roofing materials like gutters, and inside air conditioners. Electrical wires also contain copper; underneath that black or colored plastic insulation is bright colored copper wire. Copper is one of the most valuable metals to recycle. So, separating it from your other metals can earn you some “pat-on-the-back” money for recycling it at your scrap yard.
Aluminum – $
Aluminum is often painted, but unpainted, it is a whitish, silver color. It bends easily if it is thin.
Find out where to recycle aluminum scrap.
Aluminum cans are often collected and brought to the scrap yards in bulk. But cans are not the only use for this metal. You can find it in many places throughout your house, including gutters, siding, window frames, doors, and more. Although not worth a lot of money at the scrap yard, aluminum can be recycled and used again within a few months. Recycled aluminum saves 80% of the energy that was used to make it originally, so it’s important to recycle this metal.
Brass – $$
Brass is yellowish with a hint of red in it and is quite heavy.
Find a location to recycle brass near you.
You can often find brass in hardware like keys, door handles, light fixtures, and bathroom fixtures. Composed of copper and zinc, brass is used often in plumbing fixtures and also at the end of copper piping. A mid-level priced item at a scrap yard, brass can add up quickly in weight because of how dense it is.
Steel – $
Steel often rusts easily and a magnet will stick to it.
Find a location near you that recycles steel.
Steel is one of the most common metals used throughout the world. You can find it in many places, from your car to chairs, shelves, cabinets, and more. Unless you have thousands of pounds of it, you won’t get a lot of money for steel at a scrap yard. However, it is still wise to collect your scrap steel for recycling. Steel is one of the most recycled materials. It can be melted down and reused over and over.

So, separating it from your other metals can earn you some “pat-on-the-back” money for recycling it at your scrap yard. Aluminum – $ Aluminum is often painted, but unpainted, it is a whitish, silver color. It bends easily if it is thin. Find out where to recycle aluminum scrap. Aluminum cans are often collected and brought to the scrap yards in bulk. But cans are not the only use for this metal. You can find it in many places throughout your house, including gutters, siding, window frames, doors, and more. Although not worth a lot of money at the scrap yard, aluminum can be recycled and used again within a few months. Recycled aluminum saves 80% of the energy that was used to make it originally, so it’s important to recycle this metal. Brass – $$ Brass is yellowish with a hint of red in it and is quite heavy. Find a location to recycle brass near you. You can often find brass in hardware like keys, door handles, light fixtures, and bathroom fixtures. Composed of copper and zinc, brass is used often in plumbing fixtures and also at the end of copper piping. A mid-level priced item at a scrap yard, brass can add up quickly in weight because of how dense it is. Steel – $ Steel often rusts easily and a magnet will stick to it. Find a location near you that recycles steel. Steel is one of the most common metals used throughout the world. You can find it in many places, from your car to chairs, shelves, cabinets, and more. Unless you have thousands of pounds of it, you won’t get a lot of money for steel at a scrap yard. However, it is still wise to collect your scrap steel for recycling. Steel is one of the most recycled materials. It can be melted down and reused over and over.

"Recycling Mystery: Headphones, Earbuds, and Chargers","Headphones, earbuds, and chargers have become essential accessories for many of us. Because we go through so many of these accessories, they can add up to a lot of e-waste that contains plastic, metal, rubber, magnets, wiring, and chemicals. None of these materials are good for the environment — whether they end up in landfills or as litter. They need to be disposed of properly or, better still, recycled.
Electronic waste, or e-waste, is a big problem for our planet. The Global E-waste Statistics Partnership found that of the nearly 7.8 million tons of e-waste generated in the U.S. in 2019, only about 15% was recycled. Recycling electronics is important for many reasons. According to Newtech Recycling, here are some of the biggest reasons why we need to recycle our e-waste:

Prevent leaching of toxic materials into the soil and water supply from landfills.
Combat rising costs and environmental impacts of new electronics which require rare metals that are expensive to mine and could be recaptured from used electronics.
Supports the evolution of a circular economy. Research by the World Economic Forum shows that if collected and processed e-waste is worth over $62 billion annually.
Saves energy since using recycled materials uses a lot less compared to making things from new materials.

Because the life cycle of everything we use needs to be considered, let’s look at the best options for dealing with these electronic accessories when we no longer want them — whether they no longer work, or we’ve simply upgraded.
If Your Accessories Still Work, Donate Or Sell Them
When upgrading to new electronics, such as the latest smartphone, we often get new accessories with them. Before taking old accessories that still work to an e-waste drop-off, look into giving them away or selling them to someone who will use them. Here are a few ideas to help you find new homes for your electronics that still work.

Freecycle is a site for giving away stuff you don’t want to someone who can use it.
Craigslist is an online marketplace for selling — or giving away — stuff that still works. If you want to give it away, set up a regular “for sale by owner” posting and then select the “free stuff” category.
eBay is an excellent option for selling working electronics.
Best Buy has a trade-in program that will give you credit for certain brands of headphones and earbuds.
Goodwill takes both working and non-working electronics and accessories. Aligning with the Goodwill mission, they hire and train disabled and disadvantaged individuals on how to repair them. Find a Goodwill store near you and be sure to call first to verify which electronic accessories they take.
Consider donating working accessories to a local charity or school. It’s a good idea to call first to make sure they can make use of the items you have.

If They Don’t Work, Can They Be Repaired?
When headphones or earbuds don’t work anymore or they work improperly, there is a chance they can be fixed. To save money and the planet, see if you can repair them before you look for ways to recycle them.
Here’s how to find out if these sound accessories can be repaired and how to do it.
Headphones
Here are sites that can guide you through troubleshooting problems with your headphones and how to repair them.

Headphonesty has a guide for troubleshooting why your headphones aren’t working correctly and how to fix them.
Hooke Audio gives step-by-step instructions on how to repair various issues you may be having with your headphones, from wiring and BlueTooth to sound issues, this site includes videos to walk you through DIY repair.
DIY Perks has a YouTube video that walks you through the easy replacement of a headphone jack if the sound is not working correctly.

Earbuds
Earbuds come wireless and with wires. Both are electronic items that have some wiring and chemical components, so it’s important they don’t end up in the trash. These sites tell how you may be able to repair them when they stop working.

Chargers
Charging units and cords are not easy to repair. You may be able to extend the life of your cord by taping it with electrical tape when the casing starts to wear out. This helps keep the wires from breaking so they will last longer. If the charging unit no longer charges, your next best option is recycling.
If You Can’t Repair Your Electronics, Recycle
Because the materials in electronics are valuable, the number of recycling, trade-in, and take-back programs is growing. Here are some ways to recycle your e-waste:

The Earth911 database allows you to search for e-waste recycling by ZIP code.
Call2Recycle has a map that shows you where to recycle batteries used in consumer electronics.
Best Buy recycles most electronics, including headphones, earbuds, and chargers. Drop up to three products per visit.
Staples recycling takes accessories, adapters, and cables. They do not specifically list headphones, earbuds, or chargers, so call your local store to see if they will take them.
Original manufacturers often take back used accessories and refurbish them, whether they’re working or not. Visit the website of the brand that made the accessory and search for a recycling or take-back program:

Apple
Samsung
Dell
Microsoft



Always make sure to take your e-waste to a recycler that will manage your e-waste responsibly and not ship it to countries that are not equipped to manage it. Look for certification by e-Stewards, for example, which identifies responsible e-waste recyclers.
Repair and Recycle to Preserve Valuable Materials
The growing number of electronics we use translates to a lot of useful materials that should not end up in landfills. Recycling our old electronics reclaims valuable resources that can be used to make new products. In addition to reducing waste, using recycled materials requires less energy and is better for the planet than mining and manufacturing new materials. It’s more important than ever that we repair and recycle all of our electronics and the accessories that go with them.

How To Recycle eBike Batteries,"An ebike is the most efficient way to travel and reduce your climate impact. With more than 300 million ebikes on the road globally as of 2023, a wave of battery replacements. When it’s time to replace an e-bike battery, you can help reduce the need for new lithium and other minerals extraction by recycling responsibly. 
Understanding E-Bike Batteries
E-bike batteries are typically made from lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells. However, some ebike are based on the lead-acid chemistry used in automobiles. Lithium-based batteries have a lifespan of about 1,000 charges. In contrast, lead-acid batteries may last only 300 charge cycles — both types will eventually require responsible disposal. Many states forbid both kinds of batteries from their landfills.
Do not dispose of e-bike batteries in regular trash or recycling bins. Follow the specific guidelines provided by recycling programs or facilities for safe disposal​​.
Why Recycling E-Bike Batteries is Important
E-bike batteries contain materials like cobalt, graphite, and lithium, which can harm the environment and cause cancer and neurological harm if not disposed of properly. These materials can leach into groundwater and soil, posing a significant threat​​ to wildlife and humans.
Recycling e-bike batteries allows the recovery and reuse of valuable materials, reducing the need for new raw materials and minimizing your environmental footprint​​. It’s estimated that the world will need to produce two to four times as much lithium by 2030 to support the transition away from fossil fuels. Recycled batteries could provide much of that required lithium while reducing the massive amounts of water used to refine raw lithium.
How to Recycle E-Bike Batteries

Recognizing an End of Battery Life: Look for signs of aging, such as decreased performance, longer charge times, and fast-draining of a charge. Each of these symptoms indicate that the battery is nearing the end of its useful lifespan​​.
Finding a Recycling Center: Use resources like Earth911’s Locator or Call2Recycle to find local e-bike battery recycling drop-off locations near you. 
Manufacturer and Retailer Programs: Many e-bike manufacturers and retailers participate in recycling programs. You can drop off old batteries at the bike store where you bought your ebike. Brands including Giant, Trek, and Specialized support battery recycling through the industry-wide Hungry For Batteries recycling program run by Call2Recycle.org. Check if your e-bike’s brand offers such a program​​.
Mail-in Programs: If you cannot visit a local drop-off site, Call2Recycle also provides ebike battery mail-in boxes for a fee, including packaging for damaged or swollen lithium batteries that can cause fires in transit. Damaged batteries can be ground-shipped, but sending them via air freight is prohibited. 
Safe Disposal Practices: If the battery is in good condition, you can drop it off unpackaged. Ebike retailers participating in the Hungry For Batteries program are trained to handle intact batteries. If your battery is damaged, call ahead to the location to see if they will take it. Avoid skin contact with the battery materials and pack the damaged battery in a non-flammable material to reduce the chances of a fire. 

Maintenance Can Prolong Battery Life
Proper maintenance can extend the life of your e-bike battery, delaying the need for recycling. When you first get a new battery, take the time to charge it fully before using it. 
Once up and running with a new battery, store it or your bike in a space heated to between 40 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Avoid charging the battery to full capacity if you don’t plan to ride it immediately, which helps maintain its efficiency and longevity​​.
Recycling e-bike batteries is an essential step toward sustainable e-bike usage. By following the guidelines for proper disposal and participating in recycling programs, you contribute to environmental protection and the responsible use of resources. Remember to maintain your battery well to extend its life and reduce waste.

Recycling Mystery: Cellophane,"Cellophane, the crinkly film used for packaging, especially in the candy and food industries, can sometimes be biodegradable and compostable but is not recyclable. Although it shares many features of plastic wrap, such as transparency and the ability to stretch, cellophane is made from wood pulp and other plant fibers. 
Learn how to identify the type of cellophane to ensure you dispose of it correctly before composting. The coatings used to add water resistance and heat sealability to cellophane can contaminate your garden soil.
How Cellophane Is Made
Cellophane uses cellulose derived from wood pulp, cotton, or other plant fibers as its primary ingredient. The manufacturing process involves dissolving cellulose in a mixture of sodium hydroxide and carbon disulfide before it is transformed into cellophane film and immersed in an acid solution, typically sulfuric acid. Several of these chemicals are harmful, and carbon disulfide contributes to photochemical smog formation and can negatively impact workers’ respiratory, neurological, and reproductive health. Food-grade cellophane is reportedly safe for consumers and BPA-free. 
Is Your Cellophane Coated?
Most cellophane products today are treated with additional chemicals or coated with nitrocellulose, wax, or polyethylene. These products are referred to as coated or synthetic cellophane. Petroleum-based coatings make the products uncompostable because they leave microplastics or hydrocarbons in the soil.  
Uncoated cellophane is rare, but it can be composted safely. 
Check the packaging of the film you have to see if it is coated or not. You can also perform a simple test to see if your cellophane is coated: fold the material. If the fold holds, you have uncoated cellophane; if it springs back to unfolded, that’s coated cellophane.
Recyclability and Biodegradability
Uncoated cellophane can break down in a compost pile, typically within a few weeks. Research indicates that 86% of the cellulose in cellophane degrades after approximately 45 days, and up to 97% breaks down after 180 days. Community organic food waste composting programs will typically take uncoated cellophane. Add your ZIP Code to this Earth911 search to find local options. We recommend calling to confirm that the cellophane is accepted.
Coated or synthetic cellophane is not compostable due to the residual hydrocarbons it leaves in the compost. The presence of toxic carbon disulfide in coated cellophane also raises concerns regarding its compostability.
If you are unsure whether you have coated or uncoated cellophane, we recommend placing it in the garbage to avoid contaminating compost.
Where You’ll Find Cellophane
Cellophane, particularly in its biodegradable form, is gaining popularity. It is used for wrapping fresh products, baked goods, and candies and as a glossy cover for tea boxes, among other applications. Its role as a biodegradable barrier film makes cellophane suitable for manufacturing laminates, providing a more environmentally responsible alternative to traditional packaging materials.
While uncoated cellophane offers significant environmental benefits due to its compostability, coated variants pose challenges due to potential environmental hazards. As the packaging industry evolves, the need for sustainable practices becomes increasingly crucial, making the role of materials like uncoated cellophane vital in the shift towards more sustainable packaging solutions.

  We Earthlings: Every Grain Of Rice Has An Impact 
  Best of Earth911 Podcast: ePlant CEO Graham Hine Listens to the Trees","Cellophane, the crinkly film used for packaging, especially in the candy and food industries, can sometimes be biodegradable and compostable but is not recyclable. Although it shares many features of plastic wrap, such as transparency and the ability to stretch, cellophane is made from wood pulp and other plant fibers.  Learn how to identify the type of cellophane to ensure you dispose of it correctly before composting. The coatings used to add water resistance and heat sealability to cellophane can contaminate your garden soil. How Cellophane Is Made Cellophane uses cellulose derived from wood pulp, cotton, or other plant fibers as its primary ingredient. The manufacturing process involves dissolving cellulose in a mixture of sodium hydroxide and carbon disulfide before it is transformed into cellophane film and immersed in an acid solution, typically sulfuric acid. Several of these chemicals are harmful, and carbon disulfide contributes to photochemical smog formation and can negatively impact workers’ respiratory, neurological, and reproductive health. Food-grade cellophane is reportedly safe for consumers and BPA-free.  Is Your Cellophane Coated? Most cellophane products today are treated with additional chemicals or coated with nitrocellulose, wax, or polyethylene. These products are referred to as coated or synthetic cellophane. Petroleum-based coatings make the products uncompostable because they leave microplastics or hydrocarbons in the soil.   Uncoated cellophane is rare, but it can be composted safely.  Check the packaging of the film you have to see if it is coated or not. You can also perform a simple test to see if your cellophane is coated: fold the material. If the fold holds, you have uncoated cellophane; if it springs back to unfolded, that’s coated cellophane. Recyclability and Biodegradability Uncoated cellophane can break down in a compost pile, typically within a few weeks. Research indicates that 86% of the cellulose in cellophane degrades after approximately 45 days, and up to 97% breaks down after 180 days.

Recycling Mystery: Political Yard Signs,"Fall and spring are election seasons in the United States when citizens select their representatives and pick their sides on local issues. Political signs sprout up in voters’ front yards to endorse the candidates and issues they want their neighbors to also support. After the election, these signs are usually no longer usable since the year or campaign branding becomes obsolete before the next election cycle. What should we do with our political yard sign after the election cycle ends? Are political signs recyclable? What else can these materials be used for?
As always, it’s best to reuse and do our best to recycle items instead of sending them to the landfill. The materials, energy, and effort that were expended to make these signs are finite and should be conserved as much as possible.
Recycling Political Signs
Election yard signage typically has two parts: the metal stake that goes into the ground to support the sign and the sign itself with the campaign messaging. Neither of these two parts is recyclable in regular municipal curbside or drop-off recycling collection. These two sign components must be dropped off at a specialized recycling collection site.
The metal stake is typically made of steel. This material is recyclable through scrap metal recycling yards. We recommend collecting a full load of metal to recycle before you make the trip — you might even make a bit of money for your scrap metal.
The campaign sign is usually made of one of three different materials: plastic film stretched between spokes of the steel stakes, cardboard that is coated or laminated with plastic for durability, or corrugated plastic made of polypropylene and often referred to by the brand name Coroplast.
The plastic film type of sign can usually be recycled along with film plastic bags at a local grocery store or other big box stores. If possible, it’s a good idea to contact your local collection site to confirm they accept this type of plastic film.
Both the laminated cardboard and corrugated plastic are hard to recycle and will need to be dropped off at a specialty recycling drive for these materials. Add your ZIP Code in the Earth911 Locator to see if  your local municipality or solid waste district accepts #5 rigid plastic, and call ahead to see if they accept yard signs — they may hold recycling collection events after the elections wrap up. Usually, they accept both the sign and metal parts together.
Because municipalities and solid waste districts will collect a great deal of the same material, these groups will be able to drop off the materials at a specialist recycling facility that would not accept one or two signs from individuals.
Reusing Political Signs
Before trying to recycle the parts of your political yard signs, it’s best to inquire if the cause or candidate would prefer if their signs were returned to them. Reusing the sign for its intended use is the best practice because it conserves the resources needed to make new signs. The candidates or other groups that reuse their signs also benefit by cutting costs for the next election.
If you run for office or are a decision-maker for a local cause, you can directly influence the reusability of political signs. Do your best to make your election signs evergreen. Don’t print the date or year on signs and use consistent colors and logos from year to year so they can be reused again and again. Encourage supporters to return your signs or ask volunteers to round up the signs the week after the election.
Upcycling Political Signs
If your chosen candidates and causes don’t reuse their campaign signs, there are still upcycling options. If the signs are corrugated plastic or plasticized cardboard, one of the easiest projects is to just make a new sign. Simply paint over the current text and paint a new message, such as “happy birthday” or “park here.” Use chalkboard paint for extra reusability.
Because the corrugated plastic material is very durable, it has great potential for upcycling into something entirely new. Some ideas include storage cubbies, building toys, storage boxes, birdhouses, or even a geometric dome if you have enough of the material.
Use the metal stakes to support your garden plants. Or use them to make something new like a steel metal fire basket.
You may also find a local maker space that accepts signs for reuse at their facilities.
Practicing Our Values Consistently
Like so many items in our lives, campaign signs come with no end-of-life plan — even though they’re useful for just a short period. It’s easy to feel like these signs don’t belong to us and that we aren’t individually responsible for them. But after voting for candidates and measures that support our environmental, social, and moral values, we need to remember to practice those values. In most cases, it’s up to us to dispose of political yard signs responsibly at the end of the election cycle.

How To Recycle DVDs and DVD Cases,"DVDs and DVD cases are recyclable, but if you have a working DVD, it is better to donate or sell it so that others can enjoy the content without needing to make a new DVD. The DVD recycling process is specialized, requiring separating the layers that make up the discs to recover polycarbonate plastic and metals. These materials, which can harm the environment as they degrade, are repurposed for manufacturing new products such as mobile phone screens, computer components, and water bottles.
Community recycling programs are starting to accept DVDs and cases, often in partnership with specialized recycling companies. Many retailers, including bookstores, thrift stores, and video stores, will purchase DVDs for resale. Alternatively, you can offer them to others through eBay, Craigslist, or Buy Nothing groups. In addition to recycling, reaching out to local libraries, schools, or community centers can be fruitful. These institutions sometimes collect DVDs for educational use or fundraising sales, ensuring the discs get a second life.
DIY enthusiasts have also published creative ways to reuse DVDs and cases at home. From crafting unique art pieces to using DVD cases for organizing small items, these ideas give new life to what would otherwise become waste.
DVDs & DVD Cases Are Made Of Polycarbonate and Polypropylene
DVDs are made of polycarbonate, an impact-resistant glass-like #7 plastic that is recyclable. Curbside recycling programs do not accept polycarbonate; you must drop it off at a transfer station or collection box, and it can mailed to some national programs. Add your ZIP Code to search Earth911 for local and mail-in options.
If allowed to break down in the environment, polycarbonates may release bisphenol A (BPA) into groundwater and soil. BPA is known to interfere with reproductive processes in animals and “has been linked with cardiovascular disease and diabetes in humans,” according to Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Keeping DVDs and CDs, which are also made of polycarbonate, out of landfills is good for people and nature.
The cases are made of polypropylene, or #5 rigid plastics, which is widely accepted by recycling programs and generally considered safe for humans and the environment because it does not leach chemicals as it degrades. However, not all recycling programs possess the equipment to process DVD cases, so call before you drop them in your curbside bin or at a local transfer station.
Mail-In & Drop-Off DVD Recyclers & Reuse Programs
In recent years, as DVD recycling become more common, many mail-in programs have stopped accepting discs. If you’d like to recycle or sell your old movies, check the following to see current shipping costs, buy-back price lists, and donation options:

Repurposing DVDs and DVD Cases at Home
The possibilities for repurposing DVDs and cases are limited only by your imagination. DVDs can be transformed into decorative mosaics, wall art, organizers, or coasters. DVD cases also make excellent storage solutions for small crafting supplies or can be converted into picture frames. These DIY projects prevent waste and add a personal touch to your home décor while being kind to the planet.
Frequently Asked Questions
Can DVDs and their cases be recycled together?
 Yes. While DVDs and their cases are made from different types of plastic, many recycling centers are equipped to handle both. However, it’s always a good idea to check with your local recycling facility, as practices vary.
How can I find a local DVD recycling facility?
You can start with a simple online search to find a local DVD recycling facility. Search on Earth911.com using your ZIP Code to see local recycling centers. Or, contact your local waste management authority or environmental groups for more ideas and options.
How can schools and businesses contribute to DVD recycling?
 Schools and businesses can contribute significantly to DVD recycling by setting up collection programs. They can partner with local recycling facilities or participate in manufacturer take-back programs. Educating students and employees about recycling these items can also make a big difference.

2023: The Circular Economy In Review,"2023 was a tough year for sustainability, even though renewable energy investments reached new highs. An economic downturn made people less likely to spend in general. It raised the stakes for consumers, companies, and communities that want to pivot to sustainability—strap in for a quick review of a year of steps forward and back.
As humans lived through the hottest year in history, concerns about reducing our species’ environmental impact spurred personal changes, investments in new infrastructure and businesses, and a raft of sustainable product claims that didn’t pan out set the stage for a national year of hard choices. 2024 will be the year when the United States decides to lead the way to a new economy – along with the commercial benefits of being first – or falls back on fossil fuels to our peril and that of the world.
During 2023, the idea of creating a circular economy captured the imagination of many more people. The reuse of materials is the basis for a comprehensive approach to rethinking humans’ relationship with stuff and nature. Statista reports that the circular economy will double in size by 2026 to $712 billion a year, delivering new options for low-impact living. There will be a lot to learn, just as during the introduction of consumer technology, and the result will be a more sustainable society. The more intimately each of us becomes with the impact of our choices, the more sophisticated and successful our embrace of reuse to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, water waste, and other environmental damage.
Circular economies will keep materials in use much longer, sometimes perpetually, to reduce the need for extraction. But the transition from our current take-make-waste lifestyles will also include the move to 100% renewable energy. This more service-oriented economy will build reuse and recycling services into products and packaging while embracing regenerative agriculture and equitable opportunity for all.
Recycling Highlights & Lowlights
There’s a lot of ground to cover. Some of the critical events and statistics for 2023 include:
U.S. recycling rates stayed stubbornly low, near the historical average of 32%. The U.S. ranks 105th globally for recycling, according to Yale University’s Environmental Performance Index. However, widespread private investment and the Environmental Protection Agency’s aggressive new National Recycling Goal of 50% by 2030 suggest improvements in processing capabilities are coming soon.
However, decades of under-investment in recycling and reuse by the United States has discouraged younger people from participating – they think it is a scam. A Researchscape International report sponsored by Boxed Water found that only 44% of Gen Z responded that they “always” or “often” recycled, compared to 67% of Baby Boomers, 59% of Gen X, and 50% of Millennials. An over-emphasis on recycling as the only solution is counterproductive at a time when it is clear that reducing purchases of unneeded items and reusing, repairing, and reselling products is also crucial to lowering human environmental impact.
A lack of dialogue between companies and customers has created an environment of distrust. A Bain & Company survey released this month found that companies and consumers are talking past one another, focusing on different aspects of a product’s sustainability. The report explained that companies emphasize how sustainable products are sourced and made. At the same time, consumers are “more concerned about how a product can be reused, its durability, and how it will minimize waste.” Consumer preferences suggest the reduce-reuse-repair-recycle approach is the right one. However, companies must still invent new business models based on long-lived, durable products that can be easily repaired, refurbished, resold, or reused.
Progress toward making recycling easy and convenient, however, has faltered. Following investigative reports that found the widely-used How2Recycle.info plastic shopping bag program was sending most collected materials to landfills, the BagandFilmRecycling.org database went offline. How2Recycle now points to Earth911, and we are working to establish a process for vetting locations in that program.
One promising path to improved recycling, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation, saw some progress this year. Fourteen states considered laws that would require plastic manufacturers and companies that use plastic packaging to contribute to support collection and processing costs. Two states, Illinois and Maryland, passed watered-down EPR laws that call for research and establish boards to discuss future regulations. No states introduced new services, though Colorado banned plastic bags in retail stores as of January 1, 2024.
Transition Progress & Pushback
Other aspects of the transition have seen significant progress along with downright discouraging foot-dragging by companies and government.
EV sales hit a critical point, accounting for 18% of all vehicle sales globally, while U.S. EV sales rose to 7.9% of all cars and trucks sold. The economic downturn has suppressed spending on sustainable products – and many other things – while our willingness to pay a premium for environmentally responsible goods has increased. But for most people, sustainability remains a secondary consideration, following price and convenience.
Renewable energy investments have soared to $1.8 trillion in 2023, and 107GW of new capacity came online – “the largest absolute increase ever,” according to the International Energy Agency. But the economy has been a drag, as wind projects have faltered, declining in recent months to the lowest level since 2018. Today’s 440GW of installed global renewable energy generation could power almost three times the number of American homes.
At the United Nations COP28 climate meeting, oil-producing nations tried to undercut the efforts of more than 80 countries to include specific goals for ending oil- and coal-powered energy production. But in a stunning turnabout, on the final day of the meeting the delegates issued a ground-breaking statement that recognized the “need for deep, rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5 ℃ pathways.” For the first time, a COP called for “Transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner.”
The outcome was far from certain until the last minute. Climate scientist Katherine Hayhoe described COP28 as a conflict between science and greed, with greed getting the upper hand. Led by the CEO of the UAE’s national oil company, the first draft of the final statement called for “enhancing efforts toward the substitution of unabated fossil fuels, substantially reducing non-CO2 emissions such as methane, and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.” But the key term in that promise of action is “unabated,” which Hayhoe calls a” weasel word” because it “allows fossil fuel producers to weasel out of reductions by promising to capture their carbon at some time in the future (and when they get to that time, they’ll most likely claim it was too expensive/too hard to do what they promised).”
Many commentators, including scientists, environmental activists, and policymakers, point out that the final statement is packed with loopholes. Lisa Schipper of the University of Bonn in Germany, told the journal Nature that the phrase “transitioning away” is concerning. She said that a clear call for “phasing out” fossil fuels is needed.
“It is frustrating that thirty years of campaigning managed to get ‘transition away from fossil fuels’ in the COP text, but it is surrounded by so many loopholes that it has been rendered weak and ineffectual,” May Boeve, Executive Director of 350.org, said in a written statement. “The prize is finally on the table – a phaseout of fossil fuels and a world powered by renewable energy – but rather than clearing the way to it, we’ve been presented with yet another set of distracting doors that could still hold oil and gas expansion, and we don’t know just where the finance will come from.”
The historic statement at COP28 must still overcome delaying tactics by the fossil fuel industry and oil-exporting nations, including the largest exporter, the United States. The International Energy Agency warned on the final day on the meetings in Dubai that fossil fuel companies’ pledges to cut emissions are insufficient to limit warming to 1.5C.
Whether this declaration of the end of the fossil fuel era will lead to changes remains to be seen. Despite predictions that they will peak during the middle of this decade, atmospheric CO2 continues to grow, reaching 420.46 parts per million (ppm) in November 2023, compared to 417.47 ppm a year earlier. Each of us needs to take action to cut our emissions and environmental impact, as well as to prepare for climate impacts as the world warms past 1.5C.
Now What?
National government efforts to reduce emissions appear to be stymied by oil and gas company lobbying and influence—state and local governments need help to finance improved environmental oversight and effective recycling and reuse infrastructure. Companies have demonstrated that they are good at making promises, not on following through. If the demise of BagandFilmRecycling.org due to lack of industry support is any indication, they have not stepped up to follow through on their recycling promises.
The choice to act remains with individual citizens, who have the power to cut spending on harmful products, reduce waste in general, and take action to reduce their impact in their daily life. Each of us can reduce, repair, reuse, donate, and recycle to reduce the burden on nature, including several simple new actions:
Help organize and promote local reuse and recycling programs. Join 2,500+ volunteer Earth911 curators who contribute information to the Earth911 Recycling Search platform – if you own a business that accepts recyclables, add your listing for free (if you need help managing your business listings, Earth911 offers paid support programs).
Once you have a sense of your local recycling and reuse landscape, become an activist for improvements:

Ask the retailers and manufacturers you buy from to step up and make recycling and reusing their products and packaging easier, more accessible, and widely discoverable with helpful information.
Visit your city or county’s solid waste management office and learn how they plan to invest in recycling and reuse infrastructure. If they don’t have plans, propose improvements, attend meetings, and share your stories. Want to contribute an article or video to Earth911 calling for action? Contact us, and we will work with you to prepare your idea.
Start something, whether a small recycling business, a community tool-sharing program, or a campaign to urge companies and governments to take action.

Make changes in your life to lower your impact. We make many daily choices that, with minor adjustments, can reduce our environmental footprint. Buy less stuff and spend a little more to buy durable, responsible products – you’ll come out ahead financially and help the planet. Earth911 will make some editorial changes to help you cut your impact by 50%, a reduction that will send shockwaves through the economy if enough people join in. We need to lead companies, not wait for them to provide solutions.
Finally, vote in every election and talk with the candidates about your environmental priorities. When you show up, politicians listen. Ultimately, you hold them accountable for their actions when you vote.
It’s On Us, All Of Us
Don’t give up! Youth report more discouragement and hopelessness about the environment and their future amid many positive steps that point the way out of the climate crisis. But after a half-decade of rapid, often unanticipated progress in environmental awareness, the transition to renewables, and an explosion of sustainably minded products and services that finally provide meaningful alternatives, society faces the last, desperate efforts to push back against change. Progress takes courage and patience. Be resolute in the face of a noisy but declining opposition.
Yes, the volume of anti-green complaints is louder than ever, but fewer companies and governments are speaking against decarbonization and sustainability. Now is the time to consolidate progress and accelerate the transition. You can make your greatest contribution by setting an example through your sustainable actions.

  Earth911 Inspiration: Friend of All Living Things 
  Best of Earth911 Podcast: Andrea Ferris on Making Polyester Biodegradable with CICLO","2023 was a tough year for sustainability, even though renewable energy investments reached new highs. An economic downturn made people less likely to spend in general. It raised the stakes for consumers, companies, and communities that want to pivot to sustainability—strap in for a quick review of a year of steps forward and back. As humans lived through the hottest year in history, concerns about reducing our species’ environmental impact spurred personal changes, investments in new infrastructure and businesses, and a raft of sustainable product claims that didn’t pan out set the stage for a national year of hard choices. 2024 will be the year when the United States decides to lead the way to a new economy – along with the commercial benefits of being first – or falls back on fossil fuels to our peril and that of the world. During 2023, the idea of creating a circular economy captured the imagination of many more people. The reuse of materials is the basis for a comprehensive approach to rethinking humans’ relationship with stuff and nature. Statista reports that the circular economy will double in size by 2026 to $712 billion a year, delivering new options for low-impact living. There will be a lot to learn, just as during the introduction of consumer technology, and the result will be a more sustainable society. The more intimately each of us becomes with the impact of our choices, the more sophisticated and successful our embrace of reuse to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, water waste, and other environmental damage. Circular economies will keep materials in use much longer, sometimes perpetually, to reduce the need for extraction. But the transition from our current take-make-waste lifestyles will also include the move to 100% renewable energy. This more service-oriented economy will build reuse and recycling services into products and packaging while embracing regenerative agriculture and equitable opportunity for all. Recycling Highlights & Lowlights There’s a lot of ground to cover. Some of the critical events and statistics for 2023 include: U.S. recycling rates stayed stubbornly low, near the historical average of 32%. The U.S. ranks 105th globally for recycling, according to Yale University’s Environmental Performance Index. However, widespread private investment and the Environmental Protection Agency’s aggressive new National Recycling Goal of 50% by 2030 suggest improvements in processing capabilities are coming soon. However, decades of under-investment in recycling and reuse by the United States has discouraged younger people from participating – they think it is a scam. A Researchscape International report sponsored by Boxed Water found that only 44% of Gen Z responded that they “always” or “often” recycled, compared to 67% of Baby Boomers, 59% of Gen X, and 50% of Millennials. An over-emphasis on recycling as the only solution is counterproductive at a time when it is clear that reducing purchases of unneeded items and reusing, repairing, and reselling products is also crucial to lowering human environmental impact. A lack of dialogue between companies and customers has created an environment of distrust. A Bain & Company survey released this month found that companies and consumers are talking past one another, focusing on different aspects of a product’s sustainability. The report explained that companies emphasize how sustainable products are sourced and made. At the same time, consumers are “more concerned about how a product can be reused, its durability, and how it will minimize waste.” Consumer preferences suggest the reduce-reuse-repair-recycle approach is the right one. However, companies must still invent new business models based on long-lived, durable products that can be easily repaired, refurbished, resold, or reused. Progress toward making recycling easy and convenient, however, has faltered. Following investigative reports that found the widely-used How2Recycle.info plastic shopping bag program was sending most collected materials to landfills, the BagandFilmRecycling.org database went offline. How2Recycle now points to Earth911, and we are working to establish a process for vetting locations in that program. One promising path to improved recycling, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation, saw some progress this year. Fourteen states considered laws that would require plastic manufacturers and companies that use plastic packaging to contribute to support collection and processing costs. Two states, Illinois and Maryland, passed watered-down EPR laws that call for research and establish boards to discuss future regulations. No states introduced new services, though Colorado banned plastic bags in retail stores as of January 1, 2024.

A Kids’ History of Recycling,"Recycling has been around almost as long as humans; it’s one of our signature activities. If something can be repurposed, it probably has been at some point in history. But back then, there was no municipal recycling bin. How did we get the recycling system we have today?
Modern recycling of products started in the 1860s with the Salvation Army, the first organization to collect used clothes and household items for reuse by people with low incomes. When organized garbage collection began in the late 19th century, workers sorted things like they do today to separate valuable items from stuff that had to be sent to a landfill or burned. 1904, the first two tin can factories opened in Cleveland and Chicago. This meant a trash company could earn money selling tin and aluminum for reuse in new cans.
In 1905, conveyor belts were introduced to help collect reusable scraps, mostly metal and glass. Whatever was reusable was sold. People also used leftover food to feed animals instead of throwing so much of it away — today, 40% of food produced each year goes uneaten and wasted.
By 1916, the U.S. military introduced the Waste Reclamation Service to gather materials and meet the need for metal during World War I.

War Brings Change
When World War II broke out, tin, steel, and other metals shortages for the war effort made recycling a national priority. In addition to metal, the military needed nylon, rope, scrap paper, and even rags. At the beginning of the war, an estimated 1.5 billion tons of scrap metal was lying around in America, enough to build countless airplanes, weapons, over five hundred thousand tanks, or even 100 battleships.

The war made it patriotic to recycle. Families would collect and donate cans, pots, pans, and more. It was common for children to collect scrap metal, and farmers would strip spare metal from their old machinery to meet the need for war supplies. These new habits opened the door to a new industry when the war ended, and soldiers came home. Scrap metal companies, for example, continued to collect iron, steel, and aluminum to sell to the automotive industry as the number of cars in the U.S. doubled from 25.8 million in 1945 to 52.1 million in 1955.
It wasn’t until 1964 that aluminum cans replaced tin cans entirely, and the recycling industry saw demand for aluminum skyrocket. Environmental awareness grew over the following 20 years, and the first community recycling programs appeared. Recycling businesses must earn enough money to pay their bills. Rising demand for recyclable materials like aluminum, glass, and paper transformed recycling into a growing industry.
Lyndon B. Johnson
In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Solid Waste Disposal Bill, which established regulations for landfills to prevent pollution. It became clear that everything could not be sent to landfills. A growing population produced too much waste to bury it all. By the 1970s, landfills started to fill up, and cities like New York started shipping their garbage to other states that had landfill space; the public began to be concerned with the environmental impact of the take-make-waste lifestyle.
Those who did want to recycle in the 1970s had to take their recyclables to private companies by themselves, because the blue bin still did not exist. The first curbside recycling program in the US was established in 1981 in Woodbury, New Jersey, sparking other programs to be implemented worldwide. Just seven years later in the US alone there were over a thousand municipal recycling programs in place, and in four more years there would be more than four thousand more established, bringing the US’s total up to 5,404. This meant that recycling was suddenly far more convenient. In 1960, 6% of waste was recycled, and by 1990, when curbside programs were more common, that number was up to 29% of waste being recycled on average.
The Container Corporation of America held a design contest in 1970, resulting in the three chasing arrows we still use today. The creator was Gary Anderson, a 23-year-old University of Southern California college student.
Gary Anderson and his original design
States began to pass laws to encourage recycling. In 1971, Oregon introduced the first “Bottle bill,” offering a nickel for every recycled beer and soda bottle to get more people to recycle.
People who wanted to recycle had to take their recyclables to private companies because the blue recycling bin we know today did not exist. The first curbside recycling program in the U.S. was established in 1981 in Woodbury, New Jersey, sparking other programs to be implemented worldwide. Just seven years later, there were over a thousand municipal recycling programs in the U.S. By 1992, 5,404 curbside collection programs had been established.
The sudden increase in convenient recycling changed household habits. In 1960, 6% of waste was recycled; by 1990, 29% was recycled annually. Unfortunately, the recycling rate has remained near these levels, hovering around 32% in the decades since.
How Does America Recycle?
The United States relies on a single-stream recycling system, meaning you put all recyclables in the same bin, and they get sorted later. This isn’t the most efficient way to handle waste; it has focused most recycling investments on the “Big Four” materials: metal, paper, glass, and a few types of plastic. Meanwhile, thousands of new materials that do not have convenient recycling services are introduced every year.
The Environmental Protection Agency says the nation’s recycling system has yet to evolve to meet the needs of the people, who complain that confusion about what can be recycled means that many recyclables end up in landfills. The answers are better collection programs and improved systems, known as circular economies, for using recycled materials in new products. For example, after a cardboard box is recycled, the paper fibers recovered from each package must be sent to manufacturers who will reuse them. There also needs to be a robust domestic industry based on using recycled materials; today, there is more supply than demand for several recycled materials. The result is that many of the materials collected in curbside bins are sent out of the country.
The EPA argues we need standards for the circular economy so that recyclable materials are described and measured similarly. With uniform measurements, success nationwide can be calculated accurately, and cooperation between counties or states becomes more difficult. Universal recycling laws in the U.S. are needed to reduce confusion about what can be recycled and how to handle materials. Each state sets its own standards and rules. Some do better than others, and currently, California has the most comprehensive environmental laws.
What can be done?
Recycling grew alongside the system for collecting garbage, and the two systems share the same infrastructure.
Consumers are often confused by the fact that the same truck will pick up trash and recycling. The materials are separated at the facility where the trucks drop off their load, called a materials recovery facility, or MRF, which recycling professionals pronounce “murph.” Local recycling rules are typically determined by which equipment the MRF has purchased, so for example in some cities beverage bottles must have the cap on and other the cap off because of the machines that grind the bottles before the plastic is melted down.
We cannot be confident that the single-stream approach, which focuses on easy-to-recycle stuff like paper, plastics, and metal, can capture all the different materials society needs to recycle. In the meantime, specialized recycling programs are appearing for all sorts of materials, such as contact lenses, pickleballs, and medical equipment. These efforts may eventually merge with the single-stream system.
To help recycling gain ground, the United States and other nations must set out consistent ways to measure and encourage an economy based on reuse. The circular economy may one day reuse everything over and over, reducing the need to mine new metal, cut down more trees, or drill for oil to make more plastic. For now, the single-stream recycling system needs to be extended to mirror the needs of the people.
You can help support recycling and reuse by shopping for things made from recycled materials. Show the companies you and your family buy from that you care by asking for recyclable packaging and products.

Whatever was reusable was sold. People also used leftover food to feed animals instead of throwing so much of it away — today, 40% of food produced each year goes uneaten and wasted. By 1916, the U.S. military introduced the Waste Reclamation Service to gather materials and meet the need for metal during World War I. War Brings Change When World War II broke out, tin, steel, and other metals shortages for the war effort made recycling a national priority. In addition to metal, the military needed nylon, rope, scrap paper, and even rags. At the beginning of the war, an estimated 1.5 billion tons of scrap metal was lying around in America, enough to build countless airplanes, weapons, over five hundred thousand tanks, or even 100 battleships. The war made it patriotic to recycle. Families would collect and donate cans, pots, pans, and more. It was common for children to collect scrap metal, and farmers would strip spare metal from their old machinery to meet the need for war supplies. These new habits opened the door to a new industry when the war ended, and soldiers came home. Scrap metal companies, for example, continued to collect iron, steel, and aluminum to sell to the automotive industry as the number of cars in the U.S. doubled from 25.8 million in 1945 to 52.1 million in 1955. It wasn’t until 1964 that aluminum cans replaced tin cans entirely, and the recycling industry saw demand for aluminum skyrocket. Environmental awareness grew over the following 20 years, and the first community recycling programs appeared. Recycling businesses must earn enough money to pay their bills. Rising demand for recyclable materials like aluminum, glass, and paper transformed recycling into a growing industry. Lyndon B. Johnson In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Solid Waste Disposal Bill, which established regulations for landfills to prevent pollution. It became clear that everything could not be sent to landfills. A growing population produced too much waste to bury it all. By the 1970s, landfills started to fill up, and cities like New York started shipping their garbage to other states that had landfill space; the public began to be concerned with the environmental impact of the take-make-waste lifestyle. Those who did want to recycle in the 1970s had to take their recyclables to private companies by themselves, because the blue bin still did not exist. The first curbside recycling program in the US was established in 1981 in Woodbury, New Jersey, sparking other programs to be implemented worldwide. Just seven years later in the US alone there were over a thousand municipal recycling programs in place, and in four more years there would be more than four thousand more established, bringing the US’s total up to 5,404. This meant that recycling was suddenly far more convenient. In 1960, 6% of waste was recycled, and by 1990, when curbside programs were more common, that number was up to 29% of waste being recycled on average. The Container Corporation of America held a design contest in 1970, resulting in the three chasing arrows we still use today. The creator was Gary Anderson, a 23-year-old University of Southern California college student. Gary Anderson and his original design States began to pass laws to encourage recycling. In 1971, Oregon introduced the first “Bottle bill,” offering a nickel for every recycled beer and soda bottle to get more people to recycle. People who wanted to recycle had to take their recyclables to private companies because the blue recycling bin we know today did not exist. The first curbside recycling program in the U.S. was established in 1981 in Woodbury, New Jersey, sparking other programs to be implemented worldwide. Just seven years later, there were over a thousand municipal recycling programs in the U.S. By 1992, 5,404 curbside collection programs had been established. The sudden increase in convenient recycling changed household habits. In 1960, 6% of waste was recycled; by 1990, 29% was recycled annually. Unfortunately, the recycling rate has remained near these levels, hovering around 32% in the decades since. How Does America Recycle? The United States relies on a single-stream recycling system, meaning you put all recyclables in the same bin, and they get sorted later. This isn’t the most efficient way to handle waste; it has focused most recycling investments on the “Big Four” materials: metal, paper, glass, and a few types of plastic. Meanwhile, thousands of new materials that do not have convenient recycling services are introduced every year. The Environmental Protection Agency says the nation’s recycling system has yet to evolve to meet the needs of the people, who complain that confusion about what can be recycled means that many recyclables end up in landfills. The answers are better collection programs and improved systems, known as circular economies, for using recycled materials in new products. For example, after a cardboard box is recycled, the paper fibers recovered from each package must be sent to manufacturers who will reuse them. There also needs to be a robust domestic industry based on using recycled materials; today, there is more supply than demand for several recycled materials. The result is that many of the materials collected in curbside bins are sent out of the country. The EPA argues we need standards for the circular economy so that recyclable materials are described and measured similarly. With uniform measurements, success nationwide can be calculated accurately, and cooperation between counties or states becomes more difficult. Universal recycling laws in the U.S. are needed to reduce confusion about what can be recycled and how to handle materials. Each state sets its own standards and rules. Some do better than others, and currently, California has the most comprehensive environmental laws. What can be done? Recycling grew alongside the system for collecting garbage, and the two systems share the same infrastructure. Consumers are often confused by the fact that the same truck will pick up trash and recycling. The materials are separated at the facility where the trucks drop off their load, called a materials recovery facility, or MRF, which recycling professionals pronounce “murph.” Local recycling rules are typically determined by which equipment the MRF has purchased, so for example in some cities beverage bottles must have the cap on and other the cap off because of the machines that grind the bottles before the plastic is melted down. We cannot be confident that the single-stream approach, which focuses on easy-to-recycle stuff like paper, plastics, and metal, can capture all the different materials society needs to recycle. In the meantime, specialized recycling programs are appearing for all sorts of materials, such as contact lenses, pickleballs, and medical equipment. These efforts may eventually merge with the single-stream system. To help recycling gain ground, the United States and other nations must set out consistent ways to measure and encourage an economy based on reuse. The circular economy may one day reuse everything over and over, reducing the need to mine new metal, cut down more trees, or drill for oil to make more plastic. For now, the single-stream recycling system needs to be extended to mirror the needs of the people. You can help support recycling and reuse by shopping for things made from recycled materials. Show the companies you and your family buy from that you care by asking for recyclable packaging and products.

How To Recycle Nitrogenated Beer Cans,"Beer lovers know the joys of nitrogenated canned beers. A polypropylene nitrogen “widget” in the can releases its gas when you pop the top, producing a rich creamy head on the beer. But does the plastic widget make the can less recyclable?
The answer is a qualified “No.” Take this quick step to ensure your can is recycled successfully: Cut the can open and remove the widget. This ensures the aluminum will not be contaminated with plastic during the shredding process. Place the can in your aluminum bin — be sure to rinse the can and shake it dry first. If your local recycler accepts polypropylene, put the widget with your plastic recycling.
Many recycling plants have systems that can identify plastic widgets but those that don’t are likely to discard the cans. Your quick removal of the widget ensures that the can will be processed at any location that accepts aluminum.
Why the Widget?
Guinness invented the first widget in 1988, building on a draft beer system it pioneered in the 1950s. Beer kegs can carry nitro widgets, too, but they are refilled by the brewer instead of being recycled.
The Guinness widget is polypropylene and contains nitrous oxide and a small amount of the beer. It is designed to bob at the top of the can until it is opened. When the pressure in the can is released, the nitrous oxide and beer rush out, adding the gas to the beer to create a rich, creamy head.
The Breweries To Know
Nitrogenated cans were added by Samuel Adams in 2016, and Budweiser joined the nitro party in March 2020. Today, various forms of nitro widgets are used by:

AleSmith
Belching Beaver
Boddingtons Pub Ale
Breckenridge Brewing
Budweiser
Fort Point Beer Co.
Guinness
Left Hand Brewing
Rogue
Vault Brewing

Coffee and cocktail companies are experimenting with nitro cans, too. As the technology becomes more popular, you will find more cans containing widgets. The flavor benefits of the nitro widget are great. But let’s be sure to offset the potential contamination of aluminum recycling or disposal of the cans where sorting technology is not available.
Take a moment to cut your cans and remove the nitro widget; it will make your can recyclable anywhere.

Setting Up Your Home for Recycling Success in 2024,"It’s not always easy to recycle at home in the United States. Our fractured system makes every community’s rules different. Following China’s 2018 ban on recyclable imports, many programs changed what they accept, and the pandemic cut down our options even more. As the recycling system rebounds, each of us can help by doing our bit to clean and sort recyclables.
Earth911 is working to track the rapidly changing recycling system, and you can help by curating local listings to help your neighbors (take the first step here). New recycling technology, revived investment in facilities that process plastic, metal, and other materials, as well as growing corporate interest in recovering materials and satisfying your demand for recycling options for the products you buy has set the stage for a U.S. recycling recovery.
But each of us needs to participate because if we do not make the effort to get materials into the recycling system there is nothing to recycle. A successful circular economy requires all of us to join in. We can also minimize our environmental impact by buying fewer single-use products and packaging, lowering the amounts of oil, raw ores, and paper used across society. Let’s get ready by setting up our home recycling system, and we encourage you to check the Earth911 recycling guides whenever needed.
An example of a local recycling reminder poster from Pierce County, Washington.
Know the Local Rules
Unlike many European nations, the U.S. does not have a national recycling system or set of standards that define what we can and cannot recycle. Instead, every community can set its own rules, which are defined by whether materials are economically feasible to recycle. That means you need to track your local rules to understand what to put in your bin and what must go in the trash.
The Earth911 recycling locator can help you find your local recycling program’s website, or you can search your community solid waste management site for recycling information. Many programs offer downloadable posters that describe what is accepted and banned locally. It’s a great idea to print these out and place them where you separate your recyclables from the trash.
Take a moment to check the poster if you don’t know with certainty what can be placed in your recycling bin. After a few times consulting the poster, you’ll be able to recognize what’s accepted. It takes a few minutes at most each day to stay on top of your recycling, but building the habit does require some discipline. We suggest getting the kids involved, even making cleaning and separating recyclables part of their chores — you’ll be building a lifetime of good recycling habits for them
Create a Recycling Station
Local recycling operations are either “single-stream” programs that collect recyclables of all types in a single bin or “specialized,” which require separating paper, plastic, glass, and metals into separate bins. Which applies in your locality is easy to determine: Do you have one bin? If so, you are in a single-stream community and can place all accepted materials together into the bin. If you have multiple bins, well, you get the point.
Now, where do you sort your recycling? We recommend setting up a station near a sink so that you can rinse out bottles and cans easily. As a single-stream household, we have the recycling bin next to the kitchen garbage can, but you may prefer the garage or yard near where you keep your trash cans and recycling bins.
If you have access to composting services, keep your food scraps in the freezer and dump them in your bin — or your home compost pile — when the freezer space is full. The cold keeps the odor down and you won’t have to traipse back and forth as often as doing the compost work every day.
Remember the kids’ chores? Whether you have an in-house or out-back setup, have them visit the station once every day or so to sort and clean the recycling. Or, if you don’t have kids, set a reminder to do the recycling work at your preferred time of the day. It’s all about building habits that contribute to turning our one-way, trash-centric lifestyle into a circular system that reduces the need for mining or extracting and refining raw materials for the stuff you use.

Clean and Sort
A dirty can or bottle can contaminate the materials you and your neighbors take the time to sort. Rinse out bottles, giving the water a good swirl before pouring it out, and be sure to wash cans and glass containers before placing them in the bin.
Recycled materials also need to be dry before they go into the bin. At our house, we use a recycling bin as a drying rack, placing bottles and cans upside-down so that they can drip dry before we transfer them to the blue bin at the curb. You may want to take a different recycling approach in an apartment. Check your local recycling guidelines to see if you can leave the cap on or must take it off a bottle — both rules are in use and, despite efforts to create a standard, there is no system-wide rule. Follow the local rules, don’t wishcycle your way to recycling failure.
Accurate sorting is as important as cleaning materials because different materials cannot be combined in many recycling systems. If you are in a single-stream community, make sure that only materials that are accepted locally go in the bin. And if your program offers multiple bins, take the time to ensure that the right material is in the right bin.
Many colors of glass cannot be recycled when combined, so do not shatter and mix different color glass. Separate glass by color and, if your recycler does not accept glass or a certain color glass, consider dropping the material at a local transfer station. Following the China ban in 2018, many recycling systems stopped accepting glass at the curb but still take it at transfer stations when sorted by color.
At this step, you should also review what kinds of plastic you are recycling. For example, black PET (plastic #1) food trays are not compatible with clear and white plastics. Unfortunately, many communities are not currently accepting #5 plastic. If your recycling system does not accept certain plastic colors or foam meat trays, for example, you’ll need to find an alternative way to recycle it or toss it in the trash. If you do have to throw away a container, make a note and do not buy that product again. In fact, write a letter to the company saying that you will only buy their product when the packaging can be recycled in your local recycling bin.
Single-use plastic shopping bags were commonly accepted at grocery stores for recycling, but most programs are currently suspended due to the pandemic. They will be back and we encourage you to bundle up your bags for recycling when the system restarts.
Alternatives to Curbside
A regular trip to your local transfer station is probably necessary if you want to recycle more materials. For example, expanded polystyrene foam packing is not accepted in most curbside programs but can be dropped off locally. You can also take your e-commerce cardboard and other packaging to the transfer station — they are among the most recyclable things we can reuse. Most of the packaging labeled as “recyclable” cannot be placed in your bin but can be processed at a transfer station.
But wouldn’t it be great if the company that made the product or packaging would take back the material for recycling? More consumer and electronics product manufacturers are setting up national mail-in or drop-off recycling programs. Check the products you buy for recycling program information — it will typically be on the label, but you may need to visit the company’s website. If you cannot recycle something locally and there is no mail-in program, consider refraining from buying it until you have a convenient option. Again, write a letter to the company explaining why you are no longer buying the product.
If you still want to buy and recycle a product that is not accepted locally, take a look at TerraCycle’s Zero Waste Box options, which offer specialized recycling for a variety of material types, from home consumer goods packaging to office products. When the box is full, you simply mail it back for processing. It’s not cheap, but it will keep materials out of the landfill and in circulation in new products.

Track Your Waste and Recycling
To recognize your own progress, track your recycling. This can be an ornate or simple process. At our home, we do not weigh our recycling and trash, but some people do. Instead, we have a scale from 1 to 5, from small to large, and estimate the amount of recycled material versus trash we produce.
After starting out at a level “2” recycling volume, we progressed to consistently recycling at the “5” level and our trash quickly fell to one-third of its former volume. Just eyeball and record your results. It keeps you thinking about what you toss and what you recycle. This extends to the store where we can avoid buying unrecyclable products.
The rewards are also tangible financially. As we reduced our trash volume, we canceled a trash can (for which we were paying $30/month) and added a recycling bin (free). But the real benefit came at the checkout counter, where we now pay less for groceries and other products because we buy less and waste less. You could achieve a zero-waste lifestyle after only a few months of intentional effort.
Participate
The recycling system doesn’t work without our participation. But the recycling system will not change and expand to accept more materials without your participation in the planning process. Consider joining your local waste management board or county planning council committee that manages recycling programs.
Democracy is hard work, but the work pays off in material improvement in your life, the community’s health and well-being, and the planet’s health. Get involved and help ensure recycling success.

You can also take your e-commerce cardboard and other packaging to the transfer station — they are among the most recyclable things we can reuse. Most of the packaging labeled as “recyclable” cannot be placed in your bin but can be processed at a transfer station. But wouldn’t it be great if the company that made the product or packaging would take back the material for recycling? More consumer and electronics product manufacturers are setting up national mail-in or drop-off recycling programs. Check the products you buy for recycling program information — it will typically be on the label, but you may need to visit the company’s website. If you cannot recycle something locally and there is no mail-in program, consider refraining from buying it until you have a convenient option. Again, write a letter to the company explaining why you are no longer buying the product. If you still want to buy and recycle a product that is not accepted locally, take a look at TerraCycle’s Zero Waste Box options, which offer specialized recycling for a variety of material types, from home consumer goods packaging to office products. When the box is full, you simply mail it back for processing. It’s not cheap, but it will keep materials out of the landfill and in circulation in new products. Track Your Waste and Recycling To recognize your own progress, track your recycling. This can be an ornate or simple process. At our home, we do not weigh our recycling and trash, but some people do. Instead, we have a scale from 1 to 5, from small to large, and estimate the amount of recycled material versus trash we produce. After starting out at a level “2” recycling volume, we progressed to consistently recycling at the “5” level and our trash quickly fell to one-third of its former volume. Just eyeball and record your results. It keeps you thinking about what you toss and what you recycle. This extends to the store where we can avoid buying unrecyclable products. The rewards are also tangible financially. As we reduced our trash volume, we canceled a trash can (for which we were paying $30/month) and added a recycling bin (free). But the real benefit came at the checkout counter, where we now pay less for groceries and other products because we buy less and waste less. You could achieve a zero-waste lifestyle after only a few months of intentional effort. Participate The recycling system doesn’t work without our participation. But the recycling system will not change and expand to accept more materials without your participation in the planning process. Consider joining your local waste management board or county planning council committee that manages recycling programs. Democracy is hard work, but the work pays off in material improvement in your life, the community’s health and well-being, and the planet’s health. Get involved and help ensure recycling success.

Recycling Mystery: Antifreeze,"Antifreeze: Wise car owners have some stored in the garage to keep their engines running properly in extreme cold (and hot) conditions. What if it’s been sitting there too long? Can you recycle leftover antifreeze?
The good news is that antifreeze is recyclable.
What Is Antifreeze?
Antifreeze is a water-based additive that lowers the freezing point of the water in your engine and prevents boiling in high temperatures. That’s why you may have also heard it called engine coolant, and why it’s important for your car year-round.
Manufacturers typically make antifreeze with either ethylene glycol or propylene glycol. The chemical base is significant because ethylene glycol is toxic if ingested and propylene glycol is “generally recognized as safe” by the Food and Drug Administration in low doses. If you have curious little ones in your household, it’s a good idea to use propylene glycol (often marketed as “nontoxic”) antifreeze instead of ethylene glycol. This is especially important because antifreeze often has a sweet taste that attracts kids and pets. “Nontoxic” propylene glycol antifreeze can still be toxic to children and pets, so please store it out of reach.
There are also numerous colors of antifreeze — and the color matters. The most common color is green, but when buying antifreeze, you want to make sure you buy the correct color. Mixing colors can cause engine damage. Luckily, the color has no effect on the recycling market; it’s a dye that’s used for branding.
If you have your car serviced professionally, the mechanic likely tops off your coolant every time you change your oil. But it’s also a good idea to have a bottle with you, especially on long road trips or heading into winter weather.
How Is Antifreeze Recycled?
First off, do you need to recycle your antifreeze at all? If unopened, it will last indefinitely, and even once opened it should last up to eight years. Plus, good car maintenance means always keeping your coolant full.
Believe it or not, some cities will pick up antifreeze for recycling curbside. However, this option is rare, so check locally. If your local service does offer curbside antifreeze pickup, make sure you follow the container requirements and do not mix the antifreeze with any other fluids.
While many auto shops accept used motor oil, another recyclable car fluid, no national retail auto parts chains accept antifreeze at every store. Check the Earth911 database for local recycling options. If you need to dispose of new or used antifreeze, take it to your local household hazardous waste (HHW) program. A few important tips:

Don’t mix antifreeze with other automotive fluids like brake fluid or transmission fluid. Keep all liquids in separate containers.
Especially on the West Coast, many communities operate antifreeze, batteries, oil, and paint (ABOP) collection facilities that are open more often than HHW programs. That’s because ABOP are recyclable materials, whereas other HHW items (for example, pesticides and cleaners) have to be incinerated.
Many HHW locations operate swap shops where you can pick-up free products. This is a great way to get more antifreeze.

Most used antifreeze is recycled into new coolant by filtering out any metals or oil and adding new chemicals. So, you may be buying recycled antifreeze without even knowing it.

Recycling Mystery: Bulging Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Lithium-ion batteries are the driving force behind products that have redefined life over the past two decades, from smartphones to laptops. However, when they fail, lithium-ion batteries can cause fires that produce toxic fumes. A bulging battery is a clear sign of a malfunction that requires immediate attention. Still, you can recycle it if you handle it safely.
Recycling lithium-ion batteries reduces the need to extract lithium, and reusing the material will be the keystone of a sustainable, electrified life. Meeting the goals for cutting vehicle emissions by 2030 will require the world to produce three times as much lithium annually compared to 2023.
By 2050, almost 20 times more lithium battery capacity will be required to power electric vehicles, backup the electric grid, and keep people connected to the internet. Recycling every ounce of lithium available, even from malfunctioning batteries, can help meet that goal.
Spotting A Problem Battery
The signs of a malfunctioning battery are easy to recognize. Swelling of the battery pouch caused by expanding gas can distort the shape of the device it powers. For example, the iPhone in the photo below popped open because the lithium-ion pouch had swollen to about twice its original thickness. If you notice a laptop touch-pad that has shifted, it indicates that the battery has expanded so much that it bent the metal around it.
A bulging lithium-ion battery pouch.
Other signs of an approaching battery failure include overheating, leaking chemicals that indicate the pouch burst, and a strange chemical odor. While overheating is an increasingly common issue with many new electronics, you should pay attention to your laptop or phone becoming unusually hot, particularly when not in use.
When You Find A Bulging Battery
Any leakage of battery fluid is a critical issue and requires immediate attention. First, get the battery or device out of the house — a bucket partially filled with sand or setting it in a cool, dry location outside will do. Take care not to come into contact with the fluid by wearing gloves and an apron and protecting your eyes with goggles. Do not use water to clean up spilled battery chemicals, as lithium mixed with water is corrosive. Thoroughly clean any spilled material with an absorbent pad. Send the lithium material and anything you use to clean it to your local hazardous waste facility.
Preventing a fire is your first concern when you discover a malfunctioning lithium-ion battery. Immediately unplug the device and turn it off. Do not attempt to charge a bulging battery. If the battery bursts into flames, use an ABC fire extinguisher to put it out. CO2 fire extinguishers or water will not be as effective.
Move the device and battery to a colder location. Lithium is most stable between 40 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, so do not place it in the sun when moving it outside. Cooling or freezing the battery poses a concern when it is warmed later because the temperature change can cause a reaction.
If possible, remove the battery from the device and place the battery in a fire-proof container away from flammable materials — such as the bucket described above. Only do this if you’re sure you can do it safely; don’t put yourself at risk.
Ventilate the area to disperse any potentially harmful gasses.
Do not place the battery or a device containing a malfunctioning battery in the trash. They can cause fires in your garbage can, the garbage truck, or at any step in the waste sorting process. Do your neighbors and waste management workers a favor and take the steps to recycle.
Storing the Bulging Battery Before Recycling 
Once a battery is discharged, it is not likely to explode or burn spontaneously. If there are exposed contacts, tape them to avoid an accidental spark that could cause a fire.
Follow the guidance to avoid moisture, heat, and freezing temperatures when storing the battery until you can take it to a hazardous waste facility. Avoid storing the battery in a sealed container, as this could trap dangerous gasses that endanger the recycling worker who opens it.
Loosely wrapping the battery in a plastic bag will do the job. Label the bag and if required by the recycling facility, provide additional information such as the type of battery. And when you visit a hazardous waste facility, be sure to point out the risk of the bag and its contents to workers.
Add your ZIP Code in Earth911’s Recycling Locator to find a hazardous waste facility near you. Before visiting, we suggest you call to learn about their guidelines for bulging batteries.
Finishing the Job: Recycling
It is best to avoid sending your malfunctioning battery or device to a mail-in program. The U.S. Postal Service had designated lithium batteries as hazardous waste that cannot be air-shipped, and any package containing them needs to be marked “HAZMAT.”
When you transport the battery in a vehicle, be sure it is secured and cannot fall or be punctured or crushed by other items.
Batteries play a more prominent role in daily life, and some are bound to fail. Being prepared to recognize a malfunctioning battery, knowing how to handle it safely, and taking the extra steps to recycle it responsibly can contribute to a more sustainable society.

Demystifying Chemical Recycling: An Emerging Solution or a New Set of Challenges?,"The escalating plastic pollution crisis and inefficiencies in the plastic recycling system have turned many against single-use plastics and led to national and state bans on some plastic packaging. Now, the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries have launched a category of plastic processing technology called chemical recycling or advanced recycling. The plastic industry describes it as a potential panacea that can clean up millions of tons of plastic waste produced annually. Is it everything claimed?
The Ocean Conservancy recently hosted a forum to discuss their findings after examining chemical recycling. The implications of this technology are intricate, and the technology is still evolving. However, the early evidence is that chemical recycling still requires immense energy, generating large amounts of planet-warming CO2. At the same time, it does not significantly reduce the volume of plastic toxins.
“Chemical recycling is an umbrella term that captures a suite of disparate technologies,” said Dr. Anja Brandon, Associate Director of U.S. Plastics Policy at the Ocean Conservancy. She suggested that fossil fuel and plastic companies fudge these terms to confuse consumers and policymakers. “These terms are constantly changing. Its ‘chemical recycling,’ ‘advanced recycling,’ ‘molecular recycling,’ and ‘renewable technologies.’ Different companies all use different terms.”
One clear message from the event was the importance of reducing the use of plastic. As much as 40% of plastic becomes single-use packaging, which accounts for much of the plastic pollution in the oceans and landfills.
“Recycling mitigates the harm of waste and extraction, but not as much, of course, as reuse and certainly reduction is our primary strategy,” said Lynn Hoffman, Co-President of Eureka Recycling in Minneapolis and National Coordinator for the Alliance for Mission-Based Recyclers.
Hoffman noted that mechanical recycling is not without its environmental flaws but suggests that most plastics, especially single-use plastic packaging, are not recycled because of the broken economics of today’s system. It’s often cheaper to use virgin plastic because of the complexity and cost of sorting and processing plastic.

Chemical Recycling: The Spectrum of Methods
Chemical recycling describes several technologies, each a method of breaking down plastics categorized into three main types: purification, depolymerization, and conversion technologies. Each process converts the polymers in plastic into their underlying monomers, the hydrocarbon building blocks extracted from petroleum.
Purification
This method involves using solvents or heat to dissolve plastic, separating it from additives and impurities without altering its molecular structure. The recovered plastic can then be reprocessed into new materials. This method requires very clean post-consumer plastic supplies, which requires careful sorting and cleaning before the material can be processed. Purification works only with specific types of plastic.
Depolymerization
This process breaks plastic down into its constituent monomers using solvents, heat, catalysts, or enzymes. Like purification, depolymerization requires pure feed-stocks, and there are limits on the types of plastics that can be run through the process.
Conversion Technologies
Two older technologies, pyrolysis and gasification, are being repurposed and rebranded under the chemical recycling banner. Both rely on extreme heat to “crack” the polymers, breaking them down into hydrocarbon monomers. And most of that heat is produced by burning oil, coal, or natural gas.
Pyrolysis relies on intense heat and pressure to break plastic molecules into shorter-chain hydrocarbons, not monomers, resulting in a substance known as pyrolysis oil. This process is energy-intensive, requiring temperatures between 600 to 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
Like pyrolysis, but operating at even higher temperatures between 1,000 and 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, gasification breaks plastic into synthetic natural gas.
Chemical Recycling Impacts and Policy Considerations
Despite its potential to address the plastic pollution crisis, chemical recycling has significant environmental and social impacts, especially concerning carbon emissions. Current data suggests that the carbon footprint of chemical recycling is significantly higher than that of traditional mechanical recycling that grinds and melts plastic for reuse. Because chemical recycling facilities are built near oil refineries and plastic factories, they are usually next to low-income communities of color. The emissions and other toxins these chemical recycling facilities may produce raise critical questions about the technology’s role in a sustainable future.
The Ocean Conservancy panelists said that policy implications also need to be at the forefront of the discussion. The classification and regulation of chemical recycling facilities, whether treated as manufacturing entities or solid waste management facilities, have significant implications for where they are placed and the reviews required for permitting. So far, 24 states in the U.S. have passed laws reclassifying chemical recycling facilities as manufacturing entities. In other words, these states decided it is not a form of recycling.
The Challenges of Tracking Success and State Laws
Tracking the success of chemical recycling is a complex task, because the oil and gas produced is not directly comparable to recycled plastic.
The recycling industry has long relied on mass balance accounting, which compares the volume of materials sent to a recycling facility with the output. That works well for mechanical recycling, which ingests plastic and produces plastic that is weighed to estimate the percentage of materials recovered. However, because chemical recycling turns a solid plastic into an oil or gas, there is no easy way to estimate yields. Consequently, petrochemical companies can make audacious claims about the efficacy of chemical recycling that cannot be compared with mechanical recycling.
State laws will play a crucial role in shaping the recycling landscape. They help finance improvements in recycling systems and establish accountability for producers of packaging materials. However, how chemical recycling is defined and regulated by different states varies. California, for example, excludes chemical recycling, treating it as a form of manufacturing rather than recycling. On the other hand, Oregon may treat chemical recycling as a waste management practice but imposes a high burden of proof that the technology is effective before allowing a facility to operate.
Addressing the Textile Industry and Community Impacts
The ever-growing issue of textile waste, particularly from fast fashion, has made chemical recycling appear to be an attractive solution. Startups are exploring depolymerization to tackle the challenge of recycling polyester materials. However, as Dr. Brandon notes, the priority should be reducing production and consumption.
Chemical recycling facilities, like all recycling operations, have proven environmental and health impacts. As the technology evolves, it may become cleaner. For example, oil companies have suggested the CO2 emitted by depolymerization and conversion processes may be captured by a scrubber and sequestered permanently. The potential to extract additives and other impurities from mixed plastic waste using purification could produce more food-grade plastics, albeit at the potential cost of more plastic packaging.
But do we need more plastic? By reducing plastic use, society can remove a substantial amount of the problem. That’s a question each of us answers when we are shopping.
Chemical recycling’s effectiveness, environmental impacts, and societal implications require careful consideration and transparent discussion. As humanity strives to create a sustainable future, the panelists emphasized that all options must be assessed carefully with a critical eye to ensure that solutions like chemical recycling are responsibly and equitably implemented.

  The Circular Economy of Cannabis: Turning Waste into Resources 
  Best of Earth911 Podcast: Nexus Circular CEO Jodie Morgan on Plastic Recycling Progress","The escalating plastic pollution crisis and inefficiencies in the plastic recycling system have turned many against single-use plastics and led to national and state bans on some plastic packaging. Now, the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries have launched a category of plastic processing technology called chemical recycling or advanced recycling. The plastic industry describes it as a potential panacea that can clean up millions of tons of plastic waste produced annually. Is it everything claimed? The Ocean Conservancy recently hosted a forum to discuss their findings after examining chemical recycling. The implications of this technology are intricate, and the technology is still evolving. However, the early evidence is that chemical recycling still requires immense energy, generating large amounts of planet-warming CO2. At the same time, it does not significantly reduce the volume of plastic toxins. “Chemical recycling is an umbrella term that captures a suite of disparate technologies,” said Dr. Anja Brandon, Associate Director of U.S. Plastics Policy at the Ocean Conservancy. She suggested that fossil fuel and plastic companies fudge these terms to confuse consumers and policymakers. “These terms are constantly changing. Its ‘chemical recycling,’ ‘advanced recycling,’ ‘molecular recycling,’ and ‘renewable technologies.’ Different companies all use different terms.” One clear message from the event was the importance of reducing the use of plastic. As much as 40% of plastic becomes single-use packaging, which accounts for much of the plastic pollution in the oceans and landfills. “Recycling mitigates the harm of waste and extraction, but not as much, of course, as reuse and certainly reduction is our primary strategy,” said Lynn Hoffman, Co-President of Eureka Recycling in Minneapolis and National Coordinator for the Alliance for Mission-Based Recyclers. Hoffman noted that mechanical recycling is not without its environmental flaws but suggests that most plastics, especially single-use plastic packaging, are not recycled because of the broken economics of today’s system. It’s often cheaper to use virgin plastic because of the complexity and cost of sorting and processing plastic. Chemical Recycling: The Spectrum of Methods Chemical recycling describes several technologies, each a method of breaking down plastics categorized into three main types: purification, depolymerization, and conversion technologies. Each process converts the polymers in plastic into their underlying monomers, the hydrocarbon building blocks extracted from petroleum. Purification This method involves using solvents or heat to dissolve plastic, separating it from additives and impurities without altering its molecular structure. The recovered plastic can then be reprocessed into new materials. This method requires very clean post-consumer plastic supplies, which requires careful sorting and cleaning before the material can be processed. Purification works only with specific types of plastic. Depolymerization This process breaks plastic down into its constituent monomers using solvents, heat, catalysts, or enzymes. Like purification, depolymerization requires pure feed-stocks, and there are limits on the types of plastics that can be run through the process. Conversion Technologies Two older technologies, pyrolysis and gasification, are being repurposed and rebranded under the chemical recycling banner. Both rely on extreme heat to “crack” the polymers, breaking them down into hydrocarbon monomers. And most of that heat is produced by burning oil, coal, or natural gas. Pyrolysis relies on intense heat and pressure to break plastic molecules into shorter-chain hydrocarbons, not monomers, resulting in a substance known as pyrolysis oil.

Recycling Mystery: Garden Hoses,"Ah summertime, hooking up the sprinkler for the kids to run through, washing the dog in the backyard, filling up the watering can from the hose. But after dragging the hose out of the garage, some of us might notice it has cracks, holes, or leaks. You can try to repair them, but if that doesn’t work, you might be wondering, “What do I do with the old hose?”
Unfortunately, the options for recycling are basically non-existent, because of both the hose material and its shape. Most hoses are made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyurethane (PU), also known as #3 and #7 plastics for those familiar with the plastic resin ID codes. These are two of the most difficult plastic resins to recycle.
If you purchased a more expensive hose, it’s likely made of synthetic rubber, the material used to make tires and machinery belts. While there’s a great market (and demand) for tire recycling, most of the options for consumers to recycle them are car repair shops, retail stores, and household hazardous waste (HHW) programs, which are unlikely to accept your hose.
Curbside recycling programs won’t want your hose because it is a “tangler,” an item that will easily jam the machinery at the material recovery facility (MRF), just like plastic bags do.
Landfill Alternatives
Most communities encourage citizens to put their old hoses in the trash but there are upcyclng and reuse options that can keep it out of a landfill. Here are a few suggestions:

Maybe you can get another year out of the hose. Do some DIY hose repair to fix leaks.
Donate it to a second-hand store like Goodwill, which can make minor repairs and resell the hose. Call first to verify they will take it.
Upcycle your hose into a doormat, door decor, a handle for a bucket, or a wastebasket.
Some of the hose can be recycled. Using a utility knife, cut off the ends of the hose, which are typically made of metal such as steel or brass; you can then recycle these metal pieces at a scrap metal recycling facility.

Hose Helpful Hints
With limited responsible disposal options, extending the life of your hose is an effective step. The first thing to consider is paying a little extra for a rubber hose when buying a new one. Rubber hoses are often made of recycled material, so even though you might have a tough time recycling, at least the material in the hose may have had a previous life.
Additionally, rubber hoses are more resistant to kinks and punctures. Hoses made of PVC have been found to contain lead and phthalates, which can leach into the water (think twice before letting kids drink from the hose). Just like artificial Christmas trees made of PVC, taking the less expensive option may expose your household to lead.
If you live in an area subject to harsh winters, bring your hose inside before snowfall to preserve its life. Since water stays in the hose once you turn off the faucet, keeping it attached during the winter could also increase the chances of frozen pipes.

Got a question about how to recycle as specific product or type of material? Let us know, and we’ll do the research, sharing the results with the world.

"How to Recycle Nitrile, Latex, and Vinyl Sterile Gloves","Nitrile, vinyl, and latex gloves are a staple in the medical world and have become common in everyday life during the pandemic. They are not biodegradable and will endure for decades or longer in a landfill. Learning how and where to recycle them can help make more single-use gloves into downcycled products like curbside recycling bins or park benches.
Gloves contaminated with medical waste, such as blood or bodily fluids, are a form of hazardous waste that must be sent to the appropriate local hazardous waste facility. Your community may have a specific program for medical waste; if not, a hazardous waste station will do the trick. These gloves will not be recycled and are typically burned to prevent landfill contamination.
Before recycling, try reusing your gloves to make them last longer. For many years, it was assumed that sterile gloves cannot be reused without risking contamination. A 2021 study by the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, found that a pair of gloves can be used up to 20 times with proper disinfection. Alcohol, ultraviolet light, or heat treatments can be applied to the gloves between uses to make them safe.
Know Your Gloves
Three kinds of “rubber gloves” are used in healthcare, janitorial, and other jobs that require protection from infection or abrasive and caustic cleaning products. The different types of gloves cannot be mixed when recycled, so be careful to separate them.
Nitrile gloves, which are the most used, accounting for about 41% of gloves sold, are the most recyclable.
Latex gloves made from rubber are outwardly better for the environment than nitrile gloves made from oil, but latex recycling is not widely available. If you choose latex gloves, look for a glove manufacturer that offers recycling services, a “closed loop” solution to your recycling needs. Between eight and 12 percent of the population are allergic to latex, making these gloves a less popular choice.
Vinyl gloves are made with PVC, or #3 plastic, which is not recycled reliably and can ruin other types of plastic when mixed in the recycling process. Vinyl is also a recognized health hazard and has been banned in some countries. They contain phthalates, which can enter the body through the skin and are known to cause cancer. Many healthcare systems avoid using vinyl gloves.
Recycling Options
Glove manufacturer Kimberly-Clark also offers more mail-in recycling services, as personal protective equipment (PPE) became a visible and concerning source of waste, litter, and water pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Kimberly-Clark RightCycle Program provides a return process for its products. A hospital or clinic can collect and ship gloves, protective clothing, and eyeglasses – they must contain a full palette of boxed used materials, pay the shipping costs, and, in return, receive an annual report about how much they recycled. Nitrile gloves must be packed in boxes separate from other protective gear.
Medline, another medical glove maker, offers a recycling box for nitrile and latex gloves that is available for purchase by its glove customers.
EPI Canada, a medical products distributor, offers seven sizes of glove collection boxes for purchase, priced from C$19.99 to C$999.99. The boxes come with a postage-paid envelope; customers can send latex, vinyl, and vinyl-nitrate gloves.
Terracycle offers a variety of disposable glove recycling options. Terracycle’s Disposable Gloves Zero Waste Boxes do not require separating different types of gloves – the company will sort them when received and are available for medical organizations, salons, and laboratories. Prices range from $31 to $2,490, depending on size.
Community-organized glove recycling programs, which are volunteer-staffed, are springing up at university and private laboratories. For example, the California NanoSystems Institute at the University of California Santa Barbara has launched a laboratory glove recycling initiative that will share information with other organizations.

U.S. Recycling Policy: 50 State Strategies Under A Federal Umbrella,"In the U.S., the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates what is permitted in landfills nationwide. There are over 1,250 landfill locations in the U.S., and beyond a few national bans on materials each state is free to create laws that specify what materials must be recycled and what cannot be accepted at landfills.
The RCRA established universal bans to prevent certain hazardous materials from accidentally entering the environment. It also sets out uniform, satisfactory operating standards and provides for monitoring the environment around landfills to identify groundwater contamination and other impacts. The RCRA became law in 1976 and ended the dumping of hazardous waste at local landfills, enforced clean-up of contaminated land, and aimed to minimize waste.
Thanks to the RCRA, hazardous waste must be handled by hazardous disposal locations, including safely handling and transporting the materials for processing. Landfill operators must follow RCRA guidelines during the lifetime of a facility and for years after it is closed.
What can’t be dumped in landfills anywhere in the United States:

Medical waste
Oil-based paint
Explosives
Motor oil and fuels
Items containing certain heavy metals

Unfortunately, at this time, the RCRA does not govern CO2 and methane emissions from landfills, which are a major source of greenhouse gasses. Landfills account for 14% of U.S. methane emissions annually, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
What is medical waste?
Medical waste originates in doctors’ offices and hospitals and contains possible traces of blood, bodily fluids, or other things that could carry infections. The most common medical waste you might have in your home is needles. For most homes, medical waste is not a daily concern. Still, households where people with diabetes live, for example, do need to collect sharps and other medical waste for proper disposal.
Why are heavy metals regulated?
Certain heavy metals, such as mercury, are highly toxic to humans. Just a small amount ingested can cause organ damage and sickness, and many are suspected to be carcinogens. The most common harmful heavy metals are arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury. The RCRA regulates how they must be handled, transported, and disposed of to prevent heavy metals from entering the environment.
Heavy metals can contaminate soil, leaving a toxic legacy for decades or centuries. Chromium, for example, can poison the ground, preventing anything from growing. It’s essential to prevent heavy metals from entering waterways to protect public safety and nature.
Protecting our lands
The RCRA’s goal is to protect the health of land and people. Limiting pollutants in the soil and water surrounding disposal sites is a step in the right direction. one the country took almost 50 years ago. The next step is the development of recycling standards each state must follow.
Show your representatives that this matters to you by writing letters, voting for extended producer responsibility laws that provide funding for local infrastructure, and living sustainably. Every voice raised helps.

Fiberglass – An Overlooked Aquatic Pollutant,"From garbage gyres that choke aquatic life to microplastics that accumulate in the human body, plastic pollution in the ocean is a huge problem. People are starting to pay attention to ocean plastic. Another type of ocean pollution still doesn’t get much notice – fiberglass. On the coasts as well as along lakes and rivers, abandoned and derelict vessels (ADVs) break down in the water and wreak aquatic havoc.
Technically, fiberglass pollution is just another type of plastic pollution. Fiberglass, sometimes called glass fiber or fiber-reinforced plastic, is a composite material made from plastic resin (usually polyester, vinyl ester or epoxy) and glass fibers. It is extremely strong, lightweight, flexible, water resistant, and non-biodegradable. These qualities make it extremely useful for construction and aquatic applications.
Fiberglass’ durability makes it very hard to dispose of when products are no longer functional or wanted. Manufacturing fiberglass is also a very energy intensive process that uses fossil fuels and can release toxic air pollutants such as styrene, VOCs and smog.
Probably the best-known use of fiberglass is insulation. New fiberglass insulation no longer contains asbestos, and it is not considered a cancer risk. However, like asbestos, damaged fiberglass is friable, and the tiny particles are contact irritants when touched, inhaled, or ingested. When the fiberglass makes up the hull of a boat, it becomes a water pollutant as well.
Fiberglass Ocean Pollution
In 2018, a centuries-old oyster fishery in England closed due to massive die-off. Researchers traced the die-off to a new kind of microplastic pollution. Each kilogram of oyster meat examined contained up to 7,000 microscopic shards of fiberglass. Fiberglass “sheds” into the water when hulls scrape against rocks or the sandy bottom of lake shores and as paint flakes off. A study from the University of Oldenburg in Germany found that microplastics shed from boat hull coatings made up two-thirds of the pollution in the North Sea.
Many boats are dumped when the cost of disposal exceeds the resale value. Abandoned boats are found in every coastal state and in lakes and rivers. Although fiberglass is technically recyclable, there is no market for recycled fiberglass. In most cases, disposal in a landfill is the only option. But recycling capabilities vary by location, so you might be able to recycle your fiberglass boat – or at least parts of it. Much like junk cars, boats require some processing before responsible disposal. Drain fluids for recycling or disposal. Electronics and batteries should be removed and recycled, as should any valuable metals or other recyclable materials before the remaining structure is landfilled.
Although boat hulls shed fiberglass throughout their lifespan, what you do with the boat at the end of its useful life has the greatest impact on pollution. Whether abandoned on the shore, or purposely sunk, the boat will eventually break down. Fuel, heavy metals like lead, and other pollutants enter the water alongside the fiberglass particles from the decaying hull. Some of these materials enter the food chain. Sunken boats near the surface can even become a watersport and navigation hazard to other boaters. Pieces of decaying boats can become tangled in motors.
Foregoing Fiberglass
Avoiding fiberglass is the easiest way to prevent future water pollution. There are alternatives to fiberglass hulls, depending on the size and use of your boat.
Old-fashioned wooden boats are beautiful, but they can be expensive and require more maintenance than other materials. Many of the best types of wood for boat construction are hard to source sustainably.
Steel is inexpensive and easily recyclable, but heavy. Aluminum is lightweight and easily recyclable, but it’s expensive and more easily damaged than steel.
Polyethylene – essentially the same material used in beverage containers – is cheap and lightweight but can become brittle over time and is incompatible with adhesives and vinyl cement. Bio-based plastics and basalt fiber are emerging options for more sustainable hull materials.
Better Boating
The lifespan of a fiberglass boat can range from just 10 years to as long as 50 years, depending primarily on maintenance. Water can penetrate fiberglass, freezing in winter and eventually de-laminating the multi-layer cores. Long haul out periods can reduce the likelihood of winter damage.
Impeccable maintenance is one of the most important things you can do to reduce the environmental impact of your boat. Scraping, grinding, and replacement of damaged sections of hull generate fiberglass dust. When possible, do repairs away from water – ideally even indoors where dust can be vacuumed and safely disposed.
Policy Changes
Activists have suggested that better ownership records, clear licensing and insurance policies with end-of-life requirements for pleasure vessels would help reduce the number of abandoned boats.
California charges fines up to $3000 for illegally dumping boats. The state also established a vessel turn-in program to provide free boat disposal and offer grants to public agencies to help clean up abandoned vessels. In Maryland and Washington, for example, boat registration is compulsory, which makes it easier to identify owners of abandoned boats. Maryland also imposes a sales tax on new boats funds a statewide abandoned boat clean-up program.
Even if you are not a boat owner yourself, you can contribute to cleaner waterways by contacting your state and local representatives to support similar policies.

Recycling Mystery: Can I Recycle Pickeballs?,"Pickleball, one of the fastest-growing sports in America, has gained immense popularity. However, pickleball players often face disposing of old or damaged balls. Many players seek to recycle these balls rather than merely throw them away.
To recycle pickleballs, first, identify the type of plastic from which your ball is made. You will likely find this information on the packaging or by visiting the manufacturer’s website. Pickleballs are usually made of LDPE (#4 plastic), which is generally more recyclable.
Use the Earth911 Recycling Locator, enter your ZIP code, and search for “#4 rigid plastic” to find nearby recycling facilities that accept this type of plastic. However, please be aware that curbside programs and recycling centers that take these rigid plastics may not accept pickleballs because they are small and could jam sorting machinery. Call before you bin or drop-off.
Ask Your Court To Add a Recycling Bin
P3 Pickleball has introduced collection boxes for use at local courts — when full, the boxes are shipped back to the company for recycling. Other organizations and pickleball makers are working to create collection programs. Although these initiatives are still early, players can express their interest in participating. One such project is Service Pickleball; court operators can request a recycling bin, which comes with a postage-paid label to return it when full. Another is the Re-Pickle Project, which is organizing a pickleball recycling network but has not begun collecting balls yet.
If no recycling is available, try reusing old pickleballs as garage parking guides and other creative projects. Visit Pickleball Central and Jennifer’s Pickleball Blog for craft ideas.
As the sport grows, players must be attentive precyclers, choosing pickleballs that will be recyclable when broken or worn out. Ask at the court about getting a collection bin, and emphasize that the bin needs to be associated with a reliable recycler that will process the balls responsibly. If you take the time to put balls in a bin, be sure the court is following through on its recycling promise.
Help Grow a Sustainable Sport
With some research and effort, players can take steps towards more sustainable disposal of their used pickleballs. Also, do everything you can to extend the life of your pickleballs by using them for practice or drills even after they’ve lost their bounce for competitive play.
Now, get out to the court and practice your dink shot. Dominate the court, and encourage your friends to choose recyclable equipment.
Editor’s Note: Got a question about how to recycle as specific product or type of material? Let us know, and we’ll do the research, sharing the results with the world. You can help support our work, too!

Recycling Mystery: Smoke Detectors & Carbon Monoxide Detectors,"Reducing our consumption of material goods is a worthy goal. But some things you just can’t skimp on. When smoke detectors reach their expiration date, it’s time for them to go. Same with carbon monoxide detectors. You don’t want to mess around with something that can save lives. But when you need a new one, can the old one be recycled?
As with so many electronic products, end-of-life disposal is problematic. It usually takes time and effort to dispose of electronics responsibly. In nearly every case, you have to call a company or a local municipal office; cart your unwanted item somewhere; or hold onto stuff until special recycling or hazardous waste events take place — and then remember the date.
No wonder so many people don’t bother. It’s time-consuming and frustrating. We do it, though, because we know it matters to the health of the planet.
It would be nice if we had a better infrastructure for some of our recycling challenges, and hopefully, we will sooner than later. In the meantime, we’ve rounded up some information here to help you get started.
Different Types of Detectors
There are two different types of smoke detectors, ionization and photoelectric. If you’re not sure what kind you have, just look on the back. Ionization detectors will have an “I” or “ionization” printed on the unit.

Ionization smoke detectors contain an electrical circuit and a small amount of a radioactive isotope called Americium 241. Americium 241 converts air molecules into positive and negative ions that keep the electrical circuit moving and steady. When smoke enters the detector, it disrupts the electrical circuit and the alarm sounds. Americium 241 isn’t harmful to consumers when smoke detectors are used as intended. It only poses a risk if consumers attempt to disassemble the unit and break the protective casing.
Photoelectric smoke detectors don’t have any radioactive materials. Photoelectric models have an LED light that sends a steady ray of light across an inner chamber. When smoke enters the device, it scatters the light toward a sensor in the unit. The sensor detects the light and triggers the alarm.
Carbon monoxide detectors do not have any radioactive materials. Most programs will advise disposing of carbon monoxide detectors as you would photoelectric detectors. As you’ll see below, the advice for proper disposal of any of these items varies depending on which company you ask and where you live.

Why It’s Important to Recycle Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detectors
As mentioned above, ionization smoke detectors contain radioactive materials that shouldn’t be thrown in the trash. Technology is available that can recover and properly manage those materials.
Most smoke and carbon monoxide detectors connect to home electrical systems. They all have backup batteries, though, in case the power fails. Older models run solely on batteries. All smoke detector batteries should be recycled.
Both photoelectric and ionization detectors contain circuit boards, metals — including gold, and plastic. Throwing all of that away is a terrible waste of resources and exacerbates our problems with plastic pollution. The World Economic Forum states, “The earth’s richest deposits of valuable materials are sitting in landfill sites or people’s homes. More needs to be made of these resources.”

Even when we do some legwork to find out the proper way to dispose of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, we get conflicting information.
For example, First Alert’s website says, “You can dispose of photoelectric alarms in regular household waste after the batteries are removed, or preferably recycled.” However, the company has informed Earth911 readers that the smoke alarms it receives through its mail-back program are thrown away, not recycled.
Kidde’s website says, “Typically, alarms may be disposed of in your regular, residential trash.” They go on to advise checking with your local municipality.
Surprisingly, the EPA says this: “There are no special disposal instructions for ionization smoke detectors. They may be thrown away with household garbage, or your community may have a separate recycling program.”
The EPA advising us to toss radioactive materials out with our trash? We can do better.
Options for Disposing of Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detectors
Fortunately, with a little effort, we can find avenues that keep some of this electronic waste out of our landfills.
First up, manufacturers sometimes have programs that accept ready-to-toss smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. For example, First Alert will accept up to four ionization smoke detectors. The only fee is for postage. If you have more than four, First Alert charges a fee. Their website says they recycle components of the smoke detectors “when able.” They also note that some components are non-recyclable because of flame-resistant chemicals in the product.
Curie Environmental Services explains that California classifies smoke detectors as Universal Waste Electronic Devices due to their circuit boards and should not be put in the trash. (Curie also provides prepaid mail-in recycling services for ionization smoke detectors.)
EZ On the Earth, a Simi Valley, Calif.-based ewaste recycler offers mail-in smoke detector recycling for a fee.
To find local recycling centers and drop-off sites, try the Earth 911 search tool. Just type in “home electronics” and your ZIP code. You may find local facilities that recycle a variety of materials. Call ahead to confirm which items they accept.
You can also place a call to any of these local entities:

Your local recycling service
Your local Board of Health
Your local Department of Public Works

They may be able to tell you about upcoming household hazardous waste collection days for ionization detectors. Many municipal websites suggest throwing photoelectric and carbon monoxide in the trash, but they have recyclable parts (plastic, metals, circuit boards). Ask if they have recommendations for recycling centers that accept those models.
It can be hard to weed through all the recycling information out there. And to figure out who’s giving you solid information versus taking the path of least resistance. A word of advice? The wrong information will give you the easiest out. When it comes to recycling, consumers still have to do a bit of heavy lifting.

  Where Does Wastewater Go? 
  How to Green Back-to-School Shopping","Reducing our consumption of material goods is a worthy goal. But some things you just can’t skimp on. When smoke detectors reach their expiration date, it’s time for them to go. Same with carbon monoxide detectors. You don’t want to mess around with something that can save lives. But when you need a new one, can the old one be recycled? As with so many electronic products, end-of-life disposal is problematic. It usually takes time and effort to dispose of electronics responsibly. In nearly every case, you have to call a company or a local municipal office; cart your unwanted item somewhere; or hold onto stuff until special recycling or hazardous waste events take place — and then remember the date. No wonder so many people don’t bother. It’s time-consuming and frustrating. We do it, though, because we know it matters to the health of the planet. It would be nice if we had a better infrastructure for some of our recycling challenges, and hopefully, we will sooner than later. In the meantime, we’ve rounded up some information here to help you get started. Different Types of Detectors There are two different types of smoke detectors, ionization and photoelectric. If you’re not sure what kind you have, just look on the back. Ionization detectors will have an “I” or “ionization” printed on the unit. Ionization smoke detectors contain an electrical circuit and a small amount of a radioactive isotope called Americium 241. Americium 241 converts air molecules into positive and negative ions that keep the electrical circuit moving and steady. When smoke enters the detector, it disrupts the electrical circuit and the alarm sounds. Americium 241 isn’t harmful to consumers when smoke detectors are used as intended. It only poses a risk if consumers attempt to disassemble the unit and break the protective casing. Photoelectric smoke detectors don’t have any radioactive materials. Photoelectric models have an LED light that sends a steady ray of light across an inner chamber. When smoke enters the device, it scatters the light toward a sensor in the unit. The sensor detects the light and triggers the alarm. Carbon monoxide detectors do not have any radioactive materials. Most programs will advise disposing of carbon monoxide detectors as you would photoelectric detectors. As you’ll see below, the advice for proper disposal of any of these items varies depending on which company you ask and where you live. Why It’s Important to Recycle Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detectors As mentioned above, ionization smoke detectors contain radioactive materials that shouldn’t be thrown in the trash. Technology is available that can recover and properly manage those materials. Most smoke and carbon monoxide detectors connect to home electrical systems. They all have backup batteries, though, in case the power fails. Older models run solely on batteries. All smoke detector batteries should be recycled. Both photoelectric and ionization detectors contain circuit boards, metals — including gold, and plastic. Throwing all of that away is a terrible waste of resources and exacerbates our problems with plastic pollution. The World Economic Forum states, “The earth’s richest deposits of valuable materials are sitting in landfill sites or people’s homes. More needs to be made of these resources.” Mixed Messages About Recycling Even when we do some legwork to find out the proper way to dispose of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, we get conflicting information.

"Food Delivery Cold Packs: Reuse, Upcycling, & Recycling Tips","If you’re getting your meals delivered, you may already have a collection of cold packs. These gel-filled plastic bags do a great job of keeping perishable food chilled. But what do you do with the cold packs after you’ve unpacked your delivery?
Many people have turned to meal subscription services for a variety of reasons, including COVID safety measures, convenience, and portion control. Although these services range from delivering fully cooked meals to providing the ingredients and recipes so you can cook the meal yourself, they have one element in common: Many ingredients need to be cooled to keep them fresh. Gel packs, which stay frozen longer than ice, are a popular solution for food delivery services.
Consisting of sealed, thick plastic bags filled with re-freezable gel, the packs are handy and reusable. But what if you already have more than you can use? Can you recycle them?
Know Your Local Recycling Regulations
Most food delivery companies provide instructions on how to dispose of their packaging. A few even offer a take-back program — which is ideal. Closing the waste loop and making the business responsible for its waste is a sustainability best practice. If you can return the packaging to the company, take full advantage of this option!
Otherwise, study the provided disposal instructions with an open mind. The company may have good intentions but recycling requirements and availability differ by location. Know how your local recycling program works and follow the local recycling guidance.
But before you resort to recycling, consider the reuse and upcycling potential of the cold packs.
Reuse and Donation
Nearly all meal delivery companies tell you to reuse their freezer bags for personal use. That’s fine if you are just an occasional customer. We can all use a few cold packs to fill freezer space. The appliance works harder to cool air than already frozen items, so filling empty space in your freezer is a good practice to minimize your energy use.
Perhaps you could reuse one of these bags as an ice pack when a little one is hurt or when you have a headache or backache. They’re great to use in a cooler when you’re packing food to go. However, if you get meals delivered weekly, your freezer will be filled with cold packs quickly.
You can also pass along these cold packs to nonprofits. Ask around at your local food bank, churches, schools, pre-schools, Meals on Wheels, and any other organization near you that prepares and moves food. While this could relieve you of your surplus cold packs for now, this probably isn’t sustainable and you will have an excess again after a few months.

What To Do With the Goo
Before you recycle the bag, you need to dispose of the gel. Many meal delivery companies direct you to throw away the frozen goo inside their cold packs. I say try to let it air dry first to take up less landfill space. Spill the bag’s contents out onto a baking sheet and let it dry out overnight, then put it in the trash.
Although your meal delivery company may suggest you put the liquid down the drain, it’s not a good idea. Solid waste districts discourage this practice and it may clog drains.
Some companies say that you may be able to use the liquid contents as a plant fertilizer. This sounds pretty great but be wary of it unless you find out exactly what the contents are. If the manufacturer’s name is printed on the pack, you could try contacting them to request the ingredients. But if you get no response and decide to try it anyway, I’d recommend diluting the goo with water and trying it on a plant you’re not so fond of as a trial. Otherwise, the cold pack gel is not recyclable, so dispose of it in the trash.
Recycling Cold Pack Bags
Good news: The plastic bag is most likely recyclable. In most cases, the shell or envelope for the liquid cold pack is a thick film plastic. After you remove the contents, cut the bag along two or three sides so it can completely dry out before dropping off at your normal plastic film recycling location.
Most grocery stores, big-box retail chains, and mainstream hardware stores offer locations where you can drop off plastic film and bags for recycling. The bags are not recyclable in most curbside pickup municipal programs.
Upcycling
Upcycling the cold packs is also a great option. Consider what you can do with the pack when it’s not frozen. Perhaps you need some padding while packing or need something squishy between delicate stored items in the attic? The packs can be covered with cozy material and used by a tiny dog as a bed (but not used as a cushion for cats, larger dogs, or people since the packs would burst). Ask the kids you know if their dolls could use a trampoline or waterbed. Action figures might make use of squishy sandbags during a fight.
Voice Your Concerns About Packaging
Waste from meal delivery services is often high. We encourage you to pressure your food delivery service to take responsibility for the cold packs and other packaging waste they produce. If enough customers voice their concerns, it can make a difference.

Recycling Quandary: What To Do About Labels on Plastic?,"Recycling should be simple. But it isn’t. We have all stood in front of the recycling bin with an object in hand, confused about how to recycle it or if it’s even recyclable at all. Most products are made from a variety of materials – and as often as not, plastic is among them. Some types of plastic packaging are recyclable. But can you still recycle them if they have labels on them? The short answer is, probably, but it depends. That’s not very helpful, so let’s look a bit more closely.
Labels and Recycling
Different recycling facilities have different capabilities, and different types of labels may be more readily recyclable than others. When a recyclable plastic container has a label made of the same type of plastic, both are recyclable. When the label is made from paper or a different type of recyclable plastic it becomes a contaminant in the recycling process of the package.
However, most local recycling centers do not require that you remove labels from a product prior to tossing it in a recycling bin. Heat during the recycling process ensures that paper labels and glue are burned away from containers, whether they are cans, glass, or plastic bottles. If the label is made from a different type of plastic than the container, whether it is a recyclable type of plastic or not, it will contaminate the recycling. No process is perfect – some contamination is inevitable, and a few plastic labels will not ruin a large load of recycling. But the amount of contamination has a lot to do with the quality and value of the recycled material, and even whether there is a market for it at all. So, while you probably don’t have to remove labels, it’s generally good practice to do so when you can.
Plastic Containers
Of course, reducing your plastic use – especially single-use plastics – is better than recycling it. But living plastic-free is much easier said than done; sooner or later, you will find yourself trying to recycle plastic. The first thing to know is it’s a myth that the recycling symbol always means a package is recyclable. The universal recycling symbol on plastic packaging always includes resin identification codes (RICs) – numbers that indicate the type of plastic from which the item is made. The most commonly recycled plastics are #1 and #2. Plastic #5 is technically recyclable, but few curbside programs accept it.
Recyclable plastic containers may have glued-on paper labels. Because of the glue, these paper labels are not recyclable. If you can easily remove them, it can improve the quality of the recycled plastic, but it’s usually not necessary to do so, because the paper and glue will burn off when the plastic is melted. Sometimes, a plastic bottle will be wrapped in a plastic film label. This label might be vinyl or polyethylene, both of which can be recycled – but not in your curbside bin. You should remove plastic film labels from containers before recycling the container. In nearly all cases, the label itself should be disposed of as garbage.
Plastic Bags
In rare cases, a plastic film label may be labeled as #2 or #4 plastic, in which case you can treat it like other plastic films, such as grocery bags (#2) and produce bags (#4). Curbside programs no longer commonly accept these materials. The grocery store is the most likely place to accept plastic bags for recycling. When you recycle plastic film packaging, once again it is better to remove paper labels, but not absolutely necessary to do so.
Specific and Changing
Plastic is popular because it can be formulated to meet so many different and highly specific material needs. But with so many variables, it’s no surprise that municipalities have not developed a uniform way to deal with plastics. Changing commodities prices can force cities to change which materials they accept for recycling over time.
To be sure you neither waste a recyclable product nor contaminate a load of recyclables, the best course of action is to check with your local solid waste utility. They may contract with a private company to manage the recycling program. Check your utility bill and your city’s website for contact information. Ask them what materials they accept and how carefully you need to prepare those materials for recycling. If your city does not accept a type of material, don’t give up. You can use Earth911’s recycling database to find a recycling company near you that accepts whatever you need to get rid of.
Readers’ Ideas:
Marlene from Michigan has a suggestion for how to dispose of clean paper labels removed from plastic bottles and metal cans:
Place the dry clean labels in a paper shredder. To make recycling the shredded labels easier, I replace the plastic bag inside of the shredder with a brown paper shopping bag, first trimming the top edge of the bag so it fits inside the container. When the bag is about three-quarters full of shredded paper, remove it, fold over the edge, and push down gently to remove the air. Then, tape the top of the bag to prevent the shredded paper from falling out. I take these bags to one of the bins in our library parking lot. Library staff raises money for the funds. The bins will accept paper, newspapers, magazines, catalogs, neighborhood coupons, and flyers. I recommend that consumers check with their libraries to set up these bins for paper recycling and visit search.earth911.com. We can keep the paper labels from going to the landfill.

Specific and Changing Plastic is popular because it can be formulated to meet so many different and highly specific material needs. But with so many variables, it’s no surprise that municipalities have not developed a uniform way to deal with plastics. Changing commodities prices can force cities to change which materials they accept for recycling over time. To be sure you neither waste a recyclable product nor contaminate a load of recyclables, the best course of action is to check with your local solid waste utility. They may contract with a private company to manage the recycling program. Check your utility bill and your city’s website for contact information. Ask them what materials they accept and how carefully you need to prepare those materials for recycling. If your city does not accept a type of material, don’t give up. You can use Earth911’s recycling database to find a recycling company near you that accepts whatever you need to get rid of. Readers’ Ideas: Marlene from Michigan has a suggestion for how to dispose of clean paper labels removed from plastic bottles and metal cans: Place the dry clean labels in a paper shredder. To make recycling the shredded labels easier, I replace the plastic bag inside of the shredder with a brown paper shopping bag, first trimming the top edge of the bag so it fits inside the container. When the bag is about three-quarters full of shredded paper, remove it, fold over the edge, and push down gently to remove the air. Then, tape the top of the bag to prevent the shredded paper from falling out. I take these bags to one of the bins in our library parking lot. Library staff raises money for the funds. The bins will accept paper, newspapers, magazines, catalogs, neighborhood coupons, and flyers. I recommend that consumers check with their libraries to set up these bins for paper recycling and visit search.earth911.com. We can keep the paper labels from going to the landfill.

You Can Recycle Cigarette Butts!,"Did you know cigarette butts are not fully biodegradable? But there’s a solution: TerraCycle, the company that strives to find a way to recycle everything, offers a free Cigarette Waste Recycling Program. Just sign up with TerraCycle, collect the waste, and ship it to them for recycling.
After they’re tossed on the street, the beach, or wherever they fall, cigarette butts take 18 months to 10 years to break down. Because filters are made of a type of plastic, they don’t biodegrade. Instead, they release microfibers into the environment, adding to our growing problem of microplastic pollution. Discarded butts also leach chemicals and heavy metals, the same things that kill smokers, into the environment. They often wash down the street gutters, polluting our waterways and harming fish and other wildlife.
Recycling cigarette butts is an important way to clean up after ourselves. It’s good for the neighborhood or beach, and good for the planet. Are you a smoker, or do you live or work with smokers? Or perhaps you’re one of our heroes who pick up cigarette butts from the beaches, parks, or neighborhood streets. Whatever your relationship with cigarettes, TerraCycle’s program is good news for those concerned with the waste they create.
What TerraCycle Accepts
TerraCycle’s Cigarette Waste Recycling Program accepts extinguished cigarettes, cigarette filters, loose tobacco pouches, outer plastic packaging, inner foil packaging, and rolling paper, and ash. To ensure proper recycling, don’t send any other waste with these materials. (If you have paperboard packaging, recycle it through your local recycling program.) The service is free but you must provide your own containers. Airtight containers are best, to reduce odors.
Do you have a business or community location where you’d like to collect butts? You can purchase aluminum cigarette waste receptacles to install in high-traffic areas. When the container is three-quarters full, empty the cigarette waste in a plastic bag, print a free shipping label, and send it in a sturdy box to TerraCycle for safe recycling.

Tips for Successful Recycling
Make sure cigarettes are fully extinguished before you collect them.
Store the waste in a re-sealable plastic bag, disposable plastic container, plastic shopping bag, or garbage bag.
When ready to ship, secure the containers to seal in the odor and ash. Take the time to package the waste carefully to suppress the odor for you and the people who handle it in transit.
Download and print a free shipping label from TerraCycle, place your full container in a sturdy box, and ship it to TerraCycle.
How Are Cigarettes Recycled?
With funding from Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, the cigarette waste that you collect gets recycled into a variety of industrial products, such as plastic pallets. Check out this infographic from TerraCycle that explains the process.

"Recycling Plastic Clamshells and Bottles, the Same but Different","You’ve probably seen the #1 plastic resin code on various plastic containers when you’re sorting your recycling. Those containers are made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), also known as polyester. Because PET is strong, lightweight, and easily molded, it is a popular material for packaging a wide range of foods and consumer goods.
PET is one of the most recyclable plastics. It’s likely that your local recycling program accepts plastic #1 bottles and jugs. However, it may not accept plastic #1 clamshells, tubs, trays, or lids.
But if plastic #1 bottles and clamshells are both made of PET, why wouldn’t your local recycler also accept clamshells?
Same Plastic, Different Manufacturing Process
Manufacturers use different processes to produce different types of PET containers. They make clamshells using a process called thermoforming, and bottles and jugs through a process called blow molding. These distinct processes result in PET products of different grades, each with specific uses.
PET is 100% recyclable no matter what grade it is. But the PET thermoform containers pose various recycling challenges.

PET Clamshell Recycling Challenges
A 2016 article by the National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR) identified key issues with recycling PET thermoform containers such as plastic clamshells. These containers often have labels with strong adhesives that are difficult to remove. They produce more fine particles when processed and have a different bulk density than PET bottles. This makes it difficult to process clamshells and bottles together.
When plastic clamshells are processed at material recovery facilities (MRFs), operators and sorting equipment have a hard time differentiating the clamshells from other similarly shaped containers made of different plastics — and from the more desirable PET bottles. So, when the final PET bales are created to be shipped for processing, they are “contaminated” with the plastic clamshells.
The MRFs want to produce the purest bales of a given material to get the best market rate. In the case of plastic #1, those bales would include only bottles and jugs.
The recycling facilities lose money by dealing with lesser quality PET plastic when clamshells are mixed in with bottles and jugs. As a result, many recycling programs and MRFs won’t accept clamshells for recycling, even though they are made of recyclable PET plastic.
What You Can Do
If your local recycling program does not accept plastic clamshells, please be sure to keep them out of your recycling bin. But don’t throw them out — they are recyclable. In fact, NAPCOR reported that more than 100 million pounds of PET thermoform material were recycled in the U.S. in 2018.
To find a local recycling solution for plastic clamshells, enter your ZIP code in this Earth911 Recycling Search. If there are no recycling solutions near you, avoid purchasing products with plastic clamshell packaging. Also, consider contacting the manufacturer or producer. Tell them about your concerns and let them know you will purchase their product again when they switch to a type of packaging you don’t have to throw in the trash. As a consumer, you can help influence businesses to change.

How To Identify Hard-To-Recycle Composite Packaging,"Many of the products we buy come packaged in a blend of materials. Composites of paper or plastic with other materials can provide lightweight, durable packaging that protects products from breakage, moisture, and leakage. While such composite packaging may do a good job of protecting the products we purchase, it presents a recycling challenge.
Because composites are blends of different types of paper, plastics, metals, or wax, your local recycling program is unlikely to accept them in your curbside recycling bin or the local transfer station. That’s because the materials must first be separated before they can be recycled – and few materials recovery facilities (MRFs) have the capacity to do this. And because it is often not profitable, there’s little incentive.
To be an effective recycler, it’s important to understand the difference between, say, a milk jug made of HDPE (plastic #2) and a soy milk carton made of a composite of materials. The milk jug is a single type of plastic, making it easier to recycle. However, cartons are a composite of paper, plastic, and, sometimes, aluminum, so they require special processing. Unless you are sure that your recycling program accepts a type of composite packaging, putting it in your recycling bin disrupts recycling efficiency.
To start, take a look at some of the products you have at home and identify which ones have composite packaging
What Composites Are in Your Home?
Many common household items you use every day come in composite packaging. Chip bags, cereal bags, plastic and wax-coated papers, candy wrappers, pet food bags, coffee bags, packaging for cleaning and personal care products, dairy and nut milk cartons, and wrapping paper are just a few. Most food packaging is made of composites, including plastic-coated cardboard and bags. Packaging that holds a liquid is likely a composite material.
How To Identify Plastic Composites
Identifying composite plastic packaging materials can be challenging because they are made of multiple layers of different materials. However, there are a few ways to determine if a plastic-like packaging is a composite.
Look for multiple layers: Composite plastic packaging materials typically have two or more layers of different materials, such as plastic films, aluminum foil, or paper. If one side of the packaging is dull and the other is not it’s a composite material.
Check for a barrier layer: Composite plastic packaging often contains a barrier layer that helps to protect the contents from moisture, oxygen, and other external factors. The barrier layer is usually a thin layer of aluminum or another material, often #3 plastic (PVC), sandwiched between the different layers.
Check for a recycling symbol: Most plastic packaging is marked with a resin identification code that indicates the type of plastic used. Composite plastics sometimes carry a symbol with a number followed by several letters that indicate the different kinds of plastic used in the layers. They may also be marked with the #7 plastic code if they are a mix of two different types of plastic.
Check for stiffness: Plastic film composites are often stiffer than single-layer plastic films. The composite typically will not stretch like ordinary plastic film because it consists of multiple layers bonded to create a stronger and more durable material. If the material does not stretch, or has very little give to it, it’s probably a composite.
Check with the manufacturer: If container or packaging material provides no details about its material, you can contact the manufacturer for information. The manufacturer should be able to provide details about the materials used in the packaging.
Composite packaging may include a symbol similar to one of these, but they are not required.
How To Identify Composite Paper Packaging
Composite paper packaging materials are also made of multiple layers, making them more difficult to identify than single-layer paper packaging. However, here are a few ways to determine if a paper package is composite:
Look for a plastic coating: Composite paper packaging materials often have a thin layer of plastic coating applied to the paper to protect the contents from moisture and other external factors. The plastic coating can be visible or invisible depending on the package type. Tilting the paper to see if it’s slightly shiny is a good way to see if it has a thin layer of a different material on it if you aren’t sure. Paper is naturally dull while plastic is not.
Check the weight and stiffness: Composite paper packaging materials are usually heavier and stiffer than single-layer paper packaging. This is because the multiple layers of material are bonded together to create a stronger and more durable package.
Check for a metal layer: Some composite paper packages, such as those used for coffee or soup, may have a thin layer of metal foil sandwiched between the paper and the plastic coating, or it may be on the inside of the package. This metal layer helps to keep the contents hot and prevents them from leaking.
Again, if you are unsure, check with the manufacturer.
Juice boxes like this are likely a composite of paper, plastic, and aluminum.
Is Composite Packaging Recyclable?
Putting composite packaging in your recycling bin can contaminate the remaining materials in the bin. For example, the moisture barrier in a chip bag is made with #3 plastic, which contains chlorides that can ruin the reusability of any #1, #2, #4, #5, and #6 plastics mixed with it during the recycling process.
In some cases, composite materials can be separated and processed for recycling. For example, some plastic-coated paper packaging can be recycled by separating the paper and plastic layers and processing them separately. Similarly, some composite plastic packaging can be recycled by separating the different types of plastic used in the layers and processing them individually. Separating these layers is not something people can do at home and therefore adds extra steps to the recycling process.
However, in many cases, composite materials are not recyclable or are difficult to recycle. This is particularly true for packaging that contains multiple materials, such as metalized film or laminated paper. These materials can be challenging to separate and process for recycling, so they often end up in landfills or incinerators. Depending on the item, they might get recycled but usually produce lower-quality materials with limited uses.
Potential Solutions for Composite Packaging
There are two solutions to the problem of composite packaging materials, and both will play a role in reducing household waste sent to landfills. Companies are developing new recycling technologies and processes that can handle composite materials more effectively. For example, some companies are exploring chemical recycling, which involves breaking down the materials at a molecular level and then using them to create new products. However, these technologies are still in the early stages of development and have yet to be widely adopted by the industry.
However, manufacturers can make the most significant changes by adopting standardized recyclable packaging materials that are easy to identify, sort, and recycle.
How You Can Help
By being able to identify which product packaging is a composite of different materials, you can avoid contaminating your recycling by putting the wrong things in the bin. Different types of beverage cartons, for example, are widely promoted as recyclable, but not all programs can process them. If you’re not sure your local recycling program accepts a certain type of composite packaging, contact them and ask. And if you can’t recycle them locally, you can help by contacting companies whose products you often buy and encouraging them to use packaging that can be easily recycled.
Watch for future recycling guides on how to recycle different types of products made of composite materials.

For example, some plastic-coated paper packaging can be recycled by separating the paper and plastic layers and processing them separately. Similarly, some composite plastic packaging can be recycled by separating the different types of plastic used in the layers and processing them individually. Separating these layers is not something people can do at home and therefore adds extra steps to the recycling process. However, in many cases, composite materials are not recyclable or are difficult to recycle. This is particularly true for packaging that contains multiple materials, such as metalized film or laminated paper. These materials can be challenging to separate and process for recycling, so they often end up in landfills or incinerators. Depending on the item, they might get recycled but usually produce lower-quality materials with limited uses. Potential Solutions for Composite Packaging There are two solutions to the problem of composite packaging materials, and both will play a role in reducing household waste sent to landfills. Companies are developing new recycling technologies and processes that can handle composite materials more effectively. For example, some companies are exploring chemical recycling, which involves breaking down the materials at a molecular level and then using them to create new products. However, these technologies are still in the early stages of development and have yet to be widely adopted by the industry. However, manufacturers can make the most significant changes by adopting standardized recyclable packaging materials that are easy to identify, sort, and recycle. How You Can Help By being able to identify which product packaging is a composite of different materials, you can avoid contaminating your recycling by putting the wrong things in the bin. Different types of beverage cartons, for example, are widely promoted as recyclable, but not all programs can process them. If you’re not sure your local recycling program accepts a certain type of composite packaging, contact them and ask. And if you can’t recycle them locally, you can help by contacting companies whose products you often buy and encouraging them to use packaging that can be easily recycled. Watch for future recycling guides on how to recycle different types of products made of composite materials.

When and How To Get Rid of Your Old Car,"Replacing all your old stuff with new green products scratches the consumer itch and feels like doing something good for the environment. But “replace” is not one of the 3Rs of environmentalism. When you’re trying to reduce, reuse, and recycle, hanging on to your old stuff as long as possible is usually part of the equation. That’s fine for items like clothes, but the equation gets more complicated for items that continue to pollute every time you use them, like cars. Fortunately, the math isn’t very hard, and you have plenty of options for disposing of your old vehicle when it’s time to go electric.
Embodied Carbon vs Carbon Footprint
When people decide to buy a new car to be more efficient, they are thinking about their carbon footprint. A carbon footprint is a simple way to express the environmental impact of an activity. It is usually based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that activity produces, which are measured in CO2-eq. Driving a new car will have lower carbon emissions than driving an old one because newer cars are built to higher emissions standards, are usually more fuel efficient, and are less likely to leak oil or other pollutants.
But before a new vehicle drives its first mile, it has already created significant environmental impacts. Manufacturing new cars requires a lot of energy, uses a lot of materials, and often creates significant amounts of waste and pollution. The carbon footprint of everything that precedes the use of the vehicle is its embodied carbon (or sometimes, embodied energy). Material production accounts for about 20% of life cycle emissions in a fossil-fueled car. It’s closer to 40% for an electric vehicle.
Doing the Math
Whether it makes sense to upgrade depends a lot on what you drive now, and how much more efficient your new vehicle will be. It also depends on the electricity source. An EV running entirely on coal-powered electricity won’t reduce emissions as much as one powered by renewables. Replacing your three-year-old Honda Civic with a new GMC Hummer EV is not really doing the environment any favors.
Reuters used an Argonne National Laboratory model to determine the point at which an EV becomes cleaner than an equivalent gasoline car in terms of its lifetime carbon footprint. For a midsize vehicle, they determined the break-even point at 13,500 miles. Another study indicated that most EVs will offset the emissions from manufacturing by 19,000 miles. These studies compare new vehicles – “paying off” the carbon debt of a new EV would take longer if compared to a used vehicle.
Ars Technica compared the impacts of a new EV with those of a 2010 combustion engine car. They concluded that the environmental impact of the EV would match that of the old car after two years. Beyond two years, the EV would be an improvement over the old car.
You can make a similar calculation to estimate emissions for your own situation:

Look up or calculate your current vehicle’s gas mileage.
Estimate the number of miles you drive in a year.
Multiply 8,887 grams of CO2 by the number of gallons of fuel you burn in a year.
Look up the EPA emissions estimates for the EV you are considering.
Multiply the results by your annual mileage.
Look for data on the embodied carbon of the EV you are considering. If you can’t find it, use the Union of Concerned Scientists’ estimate of 12,000 pounds of CO2.
Add the value in steps 5 and 6 to calculate the first year’s emissions for the EV. Compare this to the value in step 3 for your current car.
Continue adding the values in steps 3 and 5 to their respective vehicles until the result for the EV is equal to or less than the result for your current car. This is the number of years before the old car’s footprint exceeds that of the new EV.

Some charities repair drivable vehicles and give them to people in need. Others will tow away unusable vehicles to strip for saleable parts.
Getting Rid of Your Old Car
Whether or not it makes sense to upgrade now, eventually you will need to get rid of your old car. If you are simply upgrading, trading it in or selling it is the obvious choice. You can help someone out there replace their old gas guzzler with your relatively efficient car.
But if your car is the guzzler, or if it gives up the ghost entirely, how do you dispose of it? You could donate it to charity. Some charities repair drivable vehicles and give them to people in need. Others will tow away unusable vehicles to strip for saleable parts. Be sure to find out what happens to the vehicle and how the charity disposes of any unusable parts before you donate.
By weight, vehicles are about 75% metal, both ferrous and non-ferrous, which is recyclable. The remaining 25% includes tires (which can be a challenge to recycle), fluids such as used oil, antifreeze, lubricants, gasoline or diesel, and other materials. These other materials include glass, plastic, fabric, rubber, and electronic components. Many of these materials are recyclable. Others are toxic and must be handled with care. Some materials are both toxic and recyclable. Breaking down your car requires a responsible recycler. Salvage yards are important for recycling each material found in motor vehicles. But they can also be a source of pollution and endanger the health of nearby communities without proper maintenance and regulation. Many responsible salvage yards require you to remove and dispose of automotive fluids before they accept your junk vehicle. You can find charities and recyclers using Earth911’s recycling directory.
If You Do Buy
Consider buying a more efficient secondhand vehicle. Any used car that gets better mileage than your old one is a step in the right direction, without generating additional embodied carbon costs. Also consider carefully whether you actually need a pickup or SUV – weight and aerodynamics still affect the efficiency of EVs. Whatever size vehicle you decide on, it is always best to choose the electric version.
If you don’t choose an EV (for example, because your home’s electric system won’t support it without costly upgrades or your electricity comes entirely from coal plants), choose the car with the best gas mileage that you can get. Look for vehicles with continuously variable transmissions (CVT) – they are 10% more efficient than the same model with an automatic transmission. Whatever car you own, you can reduce your transportation carbon footprint by keeping it well-maintained, never idling the engine, and driving less.

Recycling Mystery: Coffee Bags,"If you’re a java lover who purchases coffee in bags rather than metal cans, you’ve likely wondered, “Can I recycle coffee bags?” at some point. As is the case for so many packaging items, the answer is, “Maybe, but probably not curbside.”
You may have heard the phrase, “If in doubt, toss it out,” in reference to recycling. It’s preferable to discard items unless you know for sure your local recycling facility accepts them. That’s because non-recyclable items interfere with efficient sorting at the recycling facility. Sometimes, they disrupt the functioning of equipment, which often results in lost time and money and can even be hazardous for workers. Because of contamination, recycling facilities may dump out full loads of worthy recyclable items when they’re mixed with non-recyclable items.
Unfortunately, non-recycling discards often include coffee bags.
Probably Not Curbside
Unless your program specifically accepts coffee bags, including them in your curbside bin jeopardizes the recycling load.
Usually, household recycling programs do not recycle empty coffee bags, even if the exterior looks like paper or foil. Representatives from the recycling industry, including Rumpke and WM, say the flexible packaging for your java beans and grounds is often manufactured with mixed materials. For example, paper or foil bags are often lined with plastic.
Bags layered with varied materials are not in demand for recycling, the representatives said. Packaging that’s paper only is likely recyclable, but most coffee bags have an inner coating to preserve the freshness of the beans.
“If you are a coffee drinker, the best option is a reusable container. But if that’s not an option, a recyclable paper bag is best,” says Amanda Pratt of Rumpke.
Reduce Waste
On its website San Jose Recycles, the City of San Jose offers a recommendation to reduce packaging waste. “Instead of buying single bags of coffee, buy coffee beans from the bulk section of your supermarket. Bring an empty coffee bag or jar into the store for your coffee instead of using a brand new container every time.”
If you buy beans from bulk bins, ask your grocer if using your own jar or pouch is allowed.
Recycling by Mail
These TerraCycle programs offer recycling opportunities for empty coffee packaging that is not usually accepted with household recycling.
Dunkin’
Dunkin’ and TerraCycle established a free recycling program for eligible Dunkin’-brand coffee bags. If you want to participate, you need to establish a TerraCycle account and enroll online. When you’ve filled a box with Dunkin’ bags, print out a free UPS shipping label and ship off your empties.
“We encourage you to ship when your box is full to minimize the transportation carbon footprint for this program,” the TerraCycle website states.
Don Francisco’s
Don Francisco’s coffee bags from F. Gaviña & Sons are also eligible for free recycling with TerraCycle. In addition to the empty bags, the TerraCycle partnership program also accepts:

Don Francisco’s coffee pods
Café La Llave espresso coffee pods

Learn more about the free program online.
Zero Waste Box
TerraCycle accepts a variety of hard-to-recycle waste items through its fee-based Zero Waste Box program. This is a good option for businesses or organizations that generate a lot of the specified waste type. For coffee-related recyclables, these programs include:

Coffee Bags Zero Waste Box
Coffee and Tea Accessories Zero Waste Box
Coffee Capsules Zero Waste Box

TerraCycle Recycles
TerraCycle explains that the empty bags may be melted into hard plastic, which can be remolded to make new products such as park benches and picnic tables.
Mary Ellen Down of TerraCycle states, “We work with brands, retailers, and other stakeholders who fund the recycling process. We have in-house scientists and material application specialists who work out how to recycle all kinds of materials. We then use our global network of processors to convert the items into raw material, which is then sold to manufacturing companies.”
Upcycled Coffee Bags
If you’d like to upcycle your empty bags, here are some decorative and fun projects:

Weave a bag or basket from empty coffee bags; the instructions are on YouTube.
Turn a foil-lined bag into a tabletop planter (from We Must Be Dreamers) or a hanging planter (from Instructables).
Make a coffee bag bracelet with help from instructions on YouTube.

Also, check out the ESPRESSO selection of handmade accessories created from upcycled coffee bags.
Shop Wisely
Some producers, cafes, and coffee shops are working on establishing or enhancing more sustainable packaging and recycling programs.
Australian coffee roaster and cafe chain Industry Beans, for example, favors Eco Barista™ recyclable coffee bags. “These bags are made using soft plastics (polyethelyn), stripping away aluminum and using a removable valve to ensure the bag can be recycled and coffee is protected and kept fresh,” states the website.
Tell your favorite suppliers you’re eager to support their sustainability endeavors. If possible, avoid the hard-to-recycle bags by purchasing your beans in bulk at a store or coop where you can bring your own reusable container.

Mail-in Recycling Options: Household & Hearing Aid Batteries,"Small cell or button cell batteries power our remotes, watches, and medical devices like hearing aids. But knowing how to recycle them is not easy. The rules keep changing and the guidance is different depending on where you live. To help make it a bit easier, we put together a list of companies that offer mail-in programs for recycling household and hearing aid batteries.
But first, a little about why recycling batteries is such a challenge.
This article contains affiliate links. If you purchase an item through one of these links, we receive a small commission that helps fund our Recycling Directory.
Why is recycling small household and hearing aid batteries so confusing?
Some recycling programs may tell you that alkaline batteries (AA, AAA, 9-volt, C, and D-cell) are okay for your trash bin because they’re no longer made with mercury in them. But waste management providers like Republic Services say to never put batteries in your trash or curbside recycling.
Batteries pose a fire hazard in the trash since their residual energy can cause sparks. And in some states, it’s illegal to put batteries in the trash. Some have laws requiring battery manufacturers to support recycling programs. This map by Call2Recycle shows which states regulate battery recycling and their rules.
No wonder the proper disposal of household batteries is so confusing.
There are many different types of household batteries and they contain varying amounts of chemicals and heavy metals. Some have precious metals in them that can be recovered and reused, reducing the emissions and environmental impact of mining more. All batteries contain chemicals that can be damaging, some more than others. None of these are good for the environment.
Bottom line: We should always properly dispose of batteries. Follow the recycler’s instructions on how they want to receive the batteries, including putting tape on the terminals of certain battery types.
Go rechargeable — a planet-friendlier alternative to disposable batteries
The first step to reducing battery waste is to switch to rechargeable batteries. In the long run, using these for your household and medical devices is a lot less costly for you and the environment. Rechargeable batteries are available for any type of small appliance, including medical devices. When it comes to hearing aid batteries, one charge lasts a lot longer than a disposable battery.
Once your rechargeable or disposable batteries no longer work, it’s important to recycle them. Using a reliable recycler is the best way to know your dead batteries are disposed of correctly, are not harming the environment, and that materials that can be recycled are captured. The Earth911 recycling search tool can help you find a battery drop-off location near you (just enter your ZIP code). Read on to learn about mail-in recycling options.
Mail-in programs for household and small cell batteries
Mail-in battery recycling programs will charge a fee. There are a few reasons for this. Part of the cost is for the materials they provide you to safely store and ship batteries when your container is full. Other costs are from making sure containers and shipping meet federal regulations for hazardous materials to prevent contamination and fire. The program should provide detailed return instructions, and the cost should include the return shipping fee.
Hearing aid batteries are small, but because you use them regularly they can add up. You may be able to send them back to the manufacturer. Before you pay for a mail-in program, check the package your batteries came in. The manufacturer may have a recycling program or information on how to recycle their products. You can also ask your hearing aid provider if they know of the best way to recycle the types of batteries you use in your device.
The mail-in programs we found generally take most common types of rechargeable batteries and some disposables, like hearing aid batteries.
Mail-in battery recycling programs
The materials used to make batteries, whether they are disposable or rechargeable, can be used again. But different types of batteries require different processes to recycle them. It depends on the chemicals and metals they contain. So every program is going to be a little different in what they accept, depending on their process.

Call2Recycle offers battery and cell phone mail-in boxes for purchase. When the box is full, you simply ship it back. They take various sizes of household batteries, including single-use alkaline batteries, as well as cell phones. Their smallest box costs $55 and holds 20-25 pounds. Their large box costs $77.50 and holds 40-50 pounds. They also offer bigger sizes for business and commercial use.
Cirba Solutions, which recently acquired Battery Solutions, offers We Recycle boxes and kits (formerly, Big Green Box) that start at $44.95 for a 10-pound kit with sizes up to 55 pounds. They also offer large collection tubes that work in office spaces and kits for damaged batteries. Their program accepts single-use alkaline and household batteries as well as small electronics, including cell phones, tablets, and earbuds.
Lamp Master Mailback Recycling offers large volume recycling with their Dry Cell Battery Recycling Kits that starts at 1-gallon sizes for $84.95. They also offer 2.5- and 5-gallon dry cell battery recycling kits, as well as a Lithium Primary Battery Kit  for recycling lithium primary and lithium metal batteries, as well as mercury and button cell batteries, such as those that power hearing aids.

Not all mail-in programs accept single-use alkaline batteries. Make sure to read their acceptable materials list. Rechargeable batteries are easier for manufacturers to recycle and repurpose the materials, so these are more commonly accepted.
Have a plan for what you will do with used batteries
You may have other options for recycling your batteries besides fee-based mail-in programs. Your community might offer battery recycling drop-off opportunities — perhaps at e-waste events. Most office supply and electronics retailers offer battery recycling — but they are often limited to rechargeable batteries. Use Earth911 recycling search to locate drop-off locations near you.
Also, watch for community-specific recycling efforts like RecycleMyBattery drop-boxes, or subscription recycling services like Ridwell (currently serving communities in California, Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon, Texas, and Washington) that will pick up your hard to recycle items, including batteries.
Whether you use disposables or rechargeables, make sure you have a plan for recycling used batteries when they no longer hold a charge. Have a designated container to collect them and do your research ahead of time so you know where to mail or drop off the batteries when your container is full. Having a plan and keeping old batteries organized will prevent you from defaulting to the trash bin when you don’t have time to figure out where else to put them.

Solar Panel Recycling in the US: a Looming E-waste Concern,"The United States now has enough installed solar energy capacity to power 17.7 million homes. Although this is fantastic for air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, it means there is a looming e-waste issue on the horizon. At some point, the photovoltaic panels will no longer generate enough energy. Is it possible to recycle solar panels when they have reached their end of life?
The standard productive lifespan of today’s solar panels is 25 to 30 years. Over time, solar modules become less efficient in converting sunlight to electricity due to degradation. Most of the solar panels in the U.S. were installed in the last decade. The efficiency of the panels will decrease and need to be replaced. Broken solar panels are good candidates for a refurbishing program.
Currently, only a small fraction of solar panels are recycled. The lack of governmental policies, infrastructure, and foresight in the module design process makes solar panel recycling expensive and arduous. For solar energy to truly produce clean energy, we must recycle solar panels effectively.
What materials are in solar panels?
When exploring recyclability, it is helpful to consider the components that make up a solar photovoltaic (PV) panel. Silicon-based modules are comprised of glass, plastic, aluminum, and silicon. Unfortunately, they also contain trace toxic compounds, such as lead, which can leach into groundwater if not properly disposed of. Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is found in thin-film solar and is toxic and a carcinogen. Because thin-film currently constitutes less than 5% of the global module market, it is a smaller-scale concern.
How are solar panels recycled?
To recycle the modules, they must be disassembled to remove the glass and the metal components in the frames and junction boxes. Unfortunately, the remaining materials make a low-value product that is largely downcycled into low-value products. As a result, material recovery rates are often around 85%, and the demand for the recycled materials is low.
How can we improve solar panel recycling?
Extending the life of decommissioned solar modules through refurbishing is an appealing option when possible. Such initiatives create a secondary market for solar PV materials that can help keep prices down while reducing waste.
To achieve dramatic advancement in recycling initiatives’ value and recovery rates would require the direct reuse of materials in the frame, glass, tabbing, and solar cells. If they can be effectively recovered, the copper, silver, and silicon in the panels also provide a valuable recycling opportunity. For example, silicon could be recycled back into solar panels or the anodes of lithium-ion batteries.
Reclaiming these materials for reuse in new products will reduce waste while conserving energy and resources.

Where can I recycle solar panels?
Although the U.S. lacks a national policy for solar panel recycling, there is a patchwork of recycling options. The Solar Energy Industries Association’s (SEIA’s) National PV Recycling Program has designated Preferred Recycling Partners that meet certain standards. Two solar manufacturers lead the way in their recycling efforts: First Solar and SunPower. 
First Solar
First Solar has recycling facilities in the U.S., Germany, and Malaysia that recover up to 90% of materials. According to the website, up to 90% of the semiconductor material can be reused in new modules and 90% of the glass can be reused in new glass products.
SunPower
This manufacturer has a recycling collection program for its products and uses recycling partners to process the materials. SunPower’s Maxeon E-Series and X-Series direct current (DC) panels achieved Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Bronze status. This certification is a measure of safer, more sustainable products made for the circular economy.
Cascade Eco Minerals
This company has a zero-landfill commitment. It either processes all materials in-house or sends them to recycling partners. They have seven locations across the U.S. and also work with solar refurbishing providers when recycling is unnecessary.
Echo Environmental
Based in Carrollton, Texas, the company domestically recycles electronics and can process scrap metal and precious metal-bearing products, including PV modules, inverters, and charge controllers.
Are there effective solar panel recycling programs in the US?
The U.S. lacks adequate recycling infrastructure, and solar panel recycling is no exception. We need to develop a sufficient infrastructure to process the solar panel materials on a large scale. Unfortunately, solar panel recycling is not currently profitable. But recycling incentives, such as recent federal tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act that help solar manufacturers invest in recycling facilities, should help. The sustainability of the solar energy industry relies on creating a profitable recycling market that supports processors and provides manufacturers with affordable raw materials.
Are there policies promoting solar panel recycling?
The U.S. lags behind the EU in having comprehensive policies that promote safe and effective solar decommissioning. A national policy will help keep millions of modules out of landfills and promote the circular economy. In the absence of a national policy, a few states have taken actions to keep PV panels out of landfills. Some states, including California, treat solar panels as hazardous waste. Washington has a solar stewardship program requiring that manufacturers collect panels at no charge to the customer for end-of-life recycling.
Achieving a circular economy
Ultimately, solar panels need to be designed for recyclability to achieve a circular economy. Currently, the combination of mechanical, thermal, and chemical processes make PV recycling difficult and costly. Also, concerns about toxic materials in the panels make proper handling vital.
A truly comprehensive recycling strategy includes designing solar panels for recyclability by using fewer toxins and making material reclamation easier. Reducing the use of lead-based soldering used to hold electronic components together is a good first step.

"Tips for Recycling Computers, Phones, & Other E-waste Successfully","It happens to all of us, when the computer, smartphone, or another electronic device no longer meets our needs. Making your electronics last as long as possible is the most effective way to lower the carbon footprint of your digital life. If you can’t repair or upgrade it, repurpose it, sell it, trade it in, or even give it away — it’s time to consider your e-waste recycling options.
More than half of the total carbon footprint of your computer is generated when it is manufactured and 72% of a phone’s CO2 bill is due to the refining of raw materials, manufacturing, and shipping. According to the European Environmental Bureau, a smartphone would need to be used for between 25 and 232 years to completely offset its manufacturing carbon footprint. In recent years, consumers have drastically extended the average time between phone upgrades from 2.74 years in 2017 to 3.17 years in 2020. But only 17.4% of 53.6 million tons of old phones, computers, and other electronics are recycled annually.
Electronics makers and hobbyists are also offering new programs that let you repurpose a computer, tablet, iPhone, or Galaxy smartphone to use it for a different function, such as a home camera or alarm clock. But the inevitable day will come when the hardware will no longer support the latest software and no longer meets your needs — or simply no longer works. When that happens, this quick guide provides you options and offers tips to help you responsibly recycle your e-waste. Always be sure to follow these steps to remove your data and prepare your device for recycling.
Except for Monitors, e-Waste Recycling Should Be Free or Earn You Trade-in Credit
As a rule, you shouldn’t have to pay for recycling computers and smartphones, because the gold, silver, palladium, and other metals and components are worth a considerable amount of money — one expert estimates that $12 billion in unrecycled electronics are tossed in landfills annually. With the exception of flatscreen and CRT displays and TVs — which you can expect to pay a modest per-item fee ($10-$30-ish) to recycle because they require special handling — your e-waste recycling should be free.
If you are ready to upgrade, some stores and most manufacturers offer trade-in credit toward a new phone. Charities like Goodwill will also give you charitable donation receipts for your tax returns.
Many vendors will even cover shipping costs in case you can’t find a convenient local drop-off — although you’ll need to provide and do the packaging. For example:

Dell: Dell’s recycling options include their Mail-back Recycling Program for Dell products.
HP: HP offers free recycling for all brands of home office equipment through their partnership with Best Buy U.S. You can drop your equipment at a Best Buy near you or use their mailback program, operated by RLG Americas.
Samsung: The Korean electronics giant recycles its phones and PCs for free via mail, through a network of partners, or at its Samsung Experience Stores.
Apple: iPhones, Macs, and Apple TV devices can be recycled in more than 100 countries, including drop-off programs at Apple Stores.
Microsoft: The maker of Windows will recycle any device it manufactured that is not eligible for upgrade credit. The program is operated by a partner, Teladvance, and provides free shipping for a wide range of devices submitted to its trade-in program.
Google: In addition to providing ubiquitous search services, Google makes dozens of electronics products, from Chromebooks to smart thermostats and smart speakers. The company will provide a free shipping label through its recycling program partner, RLG Americas.

Why Recycle Computers and Smartphones (and Other E-waste) Responsibly
There are many reasons to keep computers and smartphones out of the garbage stream, including:

They contain toxic metals that harm the environment/ecosystem.
These toxic metals can be dangerous to people overseas — often children or prisoners — who may be picking through and disassembling these items. Be sure to use a recycling program certified by R2 or e-Stewards standards to prevent your electronics from being dumped in a low-income country.
In many states and localities, it’s illegal to put consumer electronics in your trash.
E-waste recycling recovers useful materials and saves energy.

Identifying Responsible E-cyclers for Your Computers and Smartphones
Fortunately, you don’t have to figure out what constitutes responsible e-waste recycling or research whether a given e-waste recycler is meeting those requirements. That’s been done. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency recognizes two accredited certification standards regarding responsible electronics recycling:

The R2 (Responsible Recycling) Recycling Standards
The e-Stewards Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment

If an e-waste recycling location displays certification from one of these organizations, that should be enough to satisfy your concerns that your e-waste will be handled correctly. In particular, these programs prohibit the exporting of e-waste to low-income countries, where little or no oversight of recycling, environmental, or worker safety exists.
If the recycler offers another e-cycling certification or no information, look for an R2 or e-Stewards program instead.
Finding a Place That Accepts Your To-Be-Recycled Devices
As a consumer, you aren’t actually bringing your old computers and smartphones to the big room where the recycling happens — you need to deliver your e-waste to a collection point. You can start at the Earth911 Recycling Database.
Which ones are best for you depends on various factors, including:

Convenience. How far do you have to drive and are they on any of your regular “chore routes”? (See 5 Tips to Make Recycling a Part of Your Daily Routine.)
How many items you have. Some locations may only accept a limited number of items per visit, perhaps half a dozen, or even just three. Some locations may require you to make a purchase to deposit an item.
Hours and availability. Recycling centers often have more limited hours than stores. Additionally, your recycling center may be by-appointment-only, either due to COVID restrictions (like my town’s currently is) or other reasons.

Stores and Manufacturers: Drop off, Mail in, or Schedule a Pickup
Many stores — particularly chains that sell consumer electronics like Best Buy and Staples (but not Costco, which discontinued its recycling program) — offer e-cycling for your computers, smartphones, and other e-waste.
Depending on the organization, location, and the device you want to recycle, your options will range from drop-off to mail-in or arrange for pick-up.
Here are a few retail options available in many regions of the U.S.:

Best Buy: “You can recycle up to three items per household per day (see categories below for state-specific info, and different limitations on TVs, computer monitors and laptops).”
Goodwill: Through a partnership with Dell ReConnect, Goodwill accepts computers and other electronics for recycling at over 2,000 Goodwill locations across the U.S.
Staples: Free electronics recycling of many items. In addition, if you are a Staples Rewards member, you can receive $5 credit for recycling eligible technology at Staples, limited to once per calendar month. Staples also offers a smaller credit for recycling printer ink/toner cartridges.
Amazon: Free electronics recycling of a variety of small consumer electronics through its Recycling Program. Amazon also offers credits for recycling eligible technology through its Trade-In Program. Amazon provides a free UPS shipping label for both programs.

Have a phone to recycle? Wireless carriers, such as AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, also offer trade-in programs.

Retailers Recycling Your Clothes for You,"From an environmental standpoint, the fashion industry is wearing a very bad look. Globally, 40 million tons of textiles are sent to landfills or incinerated every year and the fashion industry is responsible for over 8% of total greenhouse gas emissions. There are a lot of ways to make your wardrobe sustainable, but eventually, you’ll have to dispose of some old clothes. Fortunately, retailers are starting to make it easier to close the loop by offering clothing take-back and even resale programs.
Those that are particular about brand or condition often allow clothes to have a second life as clothing, while programs that accept anything, although convenient, rarely result in the highest use of returned items. Use this list to help you find the best option for your old clothes.
Some programs have paused during the pandemic. Call the retailer to confirm that the program is active before making a trip to the store.  
Brand Specific, Wearable
Levi’s
You can earn from $5 to $35 for each piece of used, wearable Levi’s denim you return. You’ll have to book an in-store appointment to trade in up to five items. Levi’s will resell quality items online and donate the rest. Vintage denim can be worth a lot of money, so you might be better off selling yours yourself.
Patagonia
Patagonia’s Worn Wear initiative allows consumers to trade in gently worn Patagonia clothing in-store or via mail-in exchange for retail credit up to $200.
The North Face
Through the TNF Renewed Take-Back program, you can bring your old The North Face gear to a TNF retail or outlet store for recycling. The company will repair and resell worn, returned, damaged, or defective products and sell them at an affordable price online at The North Face Renewed Collection. If the gear can’t be repaired, the company will recycle or donate it.
Any Brand, Wearable
DSW
If you live near a DSW store, you can bring in your gently used shoes for redistribution through Soles4Souls. Just tell a sales associate that you are making a donation, put your shoes in the bin, and if you have a DSW VIP account, they will give you 50 points.
Gap
Gap is the biggest retailer partnering with thredUP to recycle or resell old clothes. Order a Gap x thredUP Clean Out Kit online or request one at the store and turn your gently used clothes into shopping credit redeemable at Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, or Janie and Jack.
Madewell
Madewell partners with thredUP to give shopping credit for gently used women’s clothing, handbags, shoes, and accessories (any brand, any size) that thredUP resells from the Madewell-sponsored bag of clothes you mail in. Clothes that don’t make the cut are recycled or returned to you for a $10.99 fee.
Reformation
Reformation rewards recycling through its partnership with online reseller thredUP. When you request a clean out kit through Reformation’s website you can earn Reformation credit for your gently worn items that thredUP sells; or you can choose to donate your clothes and Reformation will give $5 to the Circular Fashion Fund.
The North Face
The North Face’s Clothes the Loop program is a partnership with Soles4Souls to take gently used clothes and shoes from any brand. Drop items at their retail and outlet stores and earn a $10 credit towards your next The North Face purchase of $100 or more.
Own Brand, Any Condition
Eileen Fisher
With the Eileen Fisher Renew program, every Eileen Fisher piece that’s returned in-store or by mail is eligible for a $5 reward credit, regardless of condition. Worn-out clothes are recycled and the rest are refurbished for sale through the program. You can use your reward credits for Eileen Fisher new or Renew items.
Girlfriend Collective
The brand that makes athletic wear from ocean plastic also has its own recycling program. Buying a $7 shipping label from ReGirlfriend allows you to return one Girlfriend item (or five pairs of socks or underwear) to be recycled into new ones. You receive $15 in-store credit for each package you mail back.
Any Brand, Any Condition
carter’s
Children’s clothing brand carter’s has partnered with TerraCycle on a mail-in recycling program for kids’ and baby clothes. Create a TerraCycle account online to download and print a free TerraCycle shipping label. Mail children’s clothes from any brand in any condition (as long as they are dry). TerraCycle will shred the clothes for recycling into furniture stuffing and home insulation. To receive 75 points for each month in which you make a donation, join carter’s Rewarding Moments Points program.
H&M
H&M began recycling clothing in 2013 and their program is still going strong. You can bring any unwanted clothes or textiles — by any brand and in any condition — to an H&M store and receive a coupon to use on your next purchase. Depending on the condition, clothes will be resold online through H&M Rewear (which also allows you to sell items directly) or recycled into other products like insulation.
Madewell
Madewell’s in-store denim recycling program accepts any brand of jeans in any condition. Through partnerships with thredUP and Cotton’s Blue Jeans Go Green™ program, jeans will either be resold (for about half the price of a new pair of jeans, you can buy second-hand Madewell jeans online through Madewell Forever) or recycled into insulation. Each time you bring in old jeans, you’ll receive $20 towards a brand-new pair of Madewell jeans.
Soma
If you live near a Soma store, you can recycle bras from any brand in any condition and receive 125 Love Soma Rewards points per bra donated. Soma partners with I Support the Girls and The Bra Recyclers to donate bras in good condition to women in need and to recycle fibers and hardware components from bras that are worn out. If there is no Soma near you, you can recycle bras through The Bra Recyclers’ mail-in program.
Zara
Zara partners with local nonprofits to collect used clothes, linens, shoes, and accessories for textile recycling or reuse. Clothes in good condition will be donated to charity; the rest will be recycled into new textiles, insulation, and car upholstery. Donations must be neatly packaged and dropped off at a Zara store in person.

Recycling Mystery: Meat Packaging,"If you buy meat in a grocery store, it likely comes on top of a plastic pad in a plastic container that’s wrapped in plastic. That’s a lot of plastic waste. Can you recycle meat packaging? Not all of it, but let’s look at what you can do.
We know how you feel. Walking through the grocery store can be overwhelming when you are trying to make environmentally conscious choices. Aisle after aisle of plastic-wrapped items and boxes with plastic-wrapped treats inside abound. It can be hard to avoid excess plastic and non-recyclable packaging while picking the best product for your family and the environment.
There are some easy ways to reduce your waste when you shop, like bringing reusable shopping bags. However, it can be hard to know what to do with the packaging of some products you may buy regularly, like the tray of chicken or steak wrapped in plastic. Here are the items that are typically used to package meat in the U.S.
What Is Meat Packaging Made From?
In most grocery stores, meat packaging consists of three pieces: a plastic tray, an absorbent plastic pad, and clear plastic wrap. Each of these items requires different handling.
Tray
The meat tray is usually made of expanded polystyrene (EPS), which is a type of plastic you may know by the brand name “Styrofoam.” It’s unlikely that you can put it in your curbside bin because the material, although it is recyclable, is not widely recycled. However, there are other options for recycling this material. You can use the Earth911 Recycling Search to check for drop-off locations near you that will accept EPS. Note that it’s listed as “#6 Plastic – Expanded” in Recycling Search, as shown below:

Unfortunately, many facilities won’t accept food containers for recycling because of food contamination, so it’s important to confirm with the facility before you take your meat trays there. If you do find a location that accepts them, remember that raw meat can carry many bacteria, so it’s essential to clean and dry the trays well before you drop them off.
Absorbent Pad
If you have ever wondered why that chunk of non-edible material is under your packaged meat, you aren’t alone. The absorbent pad has an important job. It not only keeps liquid bacteria at bay but can also keep your meat fresher longer.
The absorbent pad is usually made of silica gel or cellulose coated in plastic. It is not accepted for recycling or composting in the U.S at this time, so you’ll need to dispose of it in the trash.
Cling Film
Unfortunately, a large amount of plastic film wraps the entire meat package. In most locations, you cannot put plastic bags or film in your curbside recycling bin. These thin plastics jam sorting machinery at the recycling facility. Recycling workers must shut down the sorting machines to clear out the plastic film, disrupting operations and endangering the workers.
Because this film has been in contact with raw meat, it is unlikely to be accepted for recycling. To avoid contaminating other recyclable items, dispose of meat-soiled plastic wrap in the garbage.
However, many kinds of plastic bags and film are recyclable if you are willing to take them to a collection location for recycling. Many grocers and larger retailers accept clean and dry plastic bags, wrap, and film for recycling. Look for a bin near the front of the store, or use Earth911 Recycling Search or PlasticFilmRecycling to find a location near you.
Can We Make Better Choices?
Many companies are working hard to develop materials that are more environmentally friendly. The grocery store is a great place to start looking for more of these options. Bringing your reusable bags from home , choosing plastic-free produce, and buying items in bulk using your reusable containers are excellent options.
The completely waste-free and most sustainable option is a resealable glass container that can be placed in the dishwasher after each use. However, your grocery store is unlikely to accommodate. Typically, traditional butchers or meat counters in grocery stores will wrap your meat in paper instead of plastic, but we encourage you to ask them to use your glass container. If they refuse, tell them you’ll find a butcher who will work with you to reduce waste.
Sometimes it requires some extra effort to change our shopping habits or drop off items for recycling, but our small changes can make a big difference to our earth’s wellbeing.

Make Feb. 18 Your Day To Recycle Batteries,"Rayansh Bhavit decided to be an environmentalist in the second grade. He started helping run a network of battery recycling drop-boxes that have recovered almost 150,000 batteries since 2019 through RecycleMyBattery.org, a group of more than 150 kids.
The Edison, New Jersey, group, which is sponsored by Call2Recycle.org, was founded by Nihal Tammana in 2019. They’ve placed bins in local school district buildings, libraries, sports centers, and temples in the area. Its online battery education program has reached about 2 million people.
“It’s high time for all of us to work collectively on saving Earth in different ways we can,” Rayansh said. He helps collect and ship filled bins for processing. “If we start doing something to save earth today, maybe tomorrow seeing you someone else can join. Just like how we are doing collectively now.”

Rayansh and the RecycleMyBattery.org team encourage everyone to recycle batteries on February 18, dubbed National Battery Day by an industry organization, Battery Council International. The kids are also asking people to speak up when they see batteries thrown in the trash and to help spread knowledge about the benefits of recycling. Taking action can start at any age, and quickly make a difference for the planet.

“A small drop in the ocean can make a big difference in the world,” said Rayansh, explaining that his goal is a world without battery waste going to landfills. “I’m just a drop in the ocean. If more people get added it can really make a huge difference. For this, we want support from all the kids across the globe.”
Take a lesson from Rayansh, Nihal, and all the kids at Recycle My Battery on February 18: Clean out your old batteries and drop them at a responsible recycling location near you.

Recycling Mystery: Black-Colored Plastic,"Black-colored plastic gets its color from carbon black pigment and is commonly used in food containers like meat or produce trays and take-out, as well as for disposable coffee lids, plastic bags, and hard plastic items like DVD cases and planters. While plastic is one of the categories of things that we are encouraged to recycle — when we can’t reuse or repurpose it — not all black plastic items can be recycled.
Before we look at the do’s and don’ts of recycling black-colored plastic, here are a few general recycling reminders:

Always follow local recycling rules. Recycling programs vary by location.
If you have questions about local recycling rules, check with your local waste management provider, town, or wherever you take your recycling.
If you’re not sure if an item can be recycled, don’t put it in the recycling bin. Putting items in your bin that your local program doesn’t accept can cause significant harm and increase recycling costs.

What Makes Black-Colored Plastic Different?

Clear, white, and light-colored plastics are the most profitable to recyclers because they can be recycled into a variety of different colored plastics. Black plastic — which can only be recycled into other black plastic items — reduces a batch’s value.
Some black plastic is made using electronic waste, which contains toxic materials — not good if the recycled plastic is used to make food containers.
Optical sorting machines don’t see black items, which creates more work and expense for the recycler because black plastic items must be hand sorted.

Can You Put It In Your Curbside Bin?

DON’T put black plastics in your curbside recycling bin unless you have clear guidance that they are accepted. If you can’t reuse or repurpose these items, put them in the trash.
DO try to avoid buying items packaged in black plastic.

What About Black Plastic Bags and Film Wrap?

DO include black plastic bags, plastic film, and plastic wrap in the plastic-bag recycling you drop off at participating supermarkets and other locations. Because plastic bags and film can jam sorting machinery, they aren’t generally sorted by machine so the color isn’t a problem. (This is also why bags shouldn’t go in your curbside bin.)
But DON’T drop off black plastic bags unless they meet all of the plastic bag and film recycling requirements, which include “stretchy,” clean, and dry.

Deposit Plastic Beverage Containers
To date, I haven’t seen any black-colored plastic deposit containers (water, soda, etc.), but in case you run into some:

Liz Philpott, public relations and BottleDrop Give program coordinator for Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, says, “All our machines and equipment can handle black plastic containers, although there aren’t many for beverages. What we probably see most of is black plastic bottle caps — which, on the plastic bottles, we can take.”
If you are using deposit-bottle “reverse vending machines” to return plastic bottles, the machines will take what they take, and reject what they don’t take.

General Advice and Looking Ahead
There’s work on better sorters, new black and alternative-color dyes, and different materials. For now, your strategy should be to avoid using black-colored plastics. Let businesses know that you would prefer that they use plastic that you can recycle locally. Try to shop at places that don’t use black plastic, but instead:

Use non-black plastic, like white coffee lids.
Use compostable/biodegradable plastics for food trays, etc. But note that these items often require the high temperature of commercial composting facilities and won’t compost in your backyard compost pile. If you do have curbside compost pickup, confirm that your program accepts these items before you put them in your compost bin. Not all commercial composting facilities can process them.
Offer/support reusable alternatives, such as mugs and bags.

Scrap University Kids Makes Recycling Fun & Easy,"We have a big problem with metal recycling in the United States. Metal is easy to recycle, but so many people don’t know where to recycle it. So instead, metal ends up in garbage cans, on the side of the road, and in the ocean.  Did you know that only 45% of aluminum beverage cans are recycled in the United States even though they are 100% recyclable?
But it’s not just aluminum; all metal can be recycled, yet much of it isn’t. A group of us (Brad, a metal recycling guru; Shaziya, a school teacher; and Jessica, a scuba diver) decided it was time to make a lasting, positive impact on the health of our planet. We want to start this mission by educating children about why recycling is important and spreading the word on how metal recycling can be easy for everyone. We founded Scrap University Kids in April 2022 to tackle the metal recycling problem together.
Scrap University Kids
At Scrap University Kids, we are committed to teaching children that their everyday actions make a lasting impact on the environment. If more people make the effort to use recyclable materials like metal cans — and then recycle those materials when they’re done with them — we can preserve valuable resources and reduce landfill waste. Our goal is to eliminate metal from the waste stream within the next 30 years through education.
What’s the first step in our mission? It involves books and storytelling. We just published our first picture book for children grades K–4. The Girl Who Recycled 1 Million Cans is a fun tale that educates children about the environmental and financial benefits of metal recycling. The engaging story takes young readers on the journey of a girl who wants to buy a unicorn with the proceeds from recycling 1 million cans.

The next books in the series will broaden kids’ awareness and understanding of metals, how they’re recycled, and why it’s important to never throw metal in the garbage. We are starting with storybooks but will also have fun online classes and a cartoon series about metal recycling.
Teaching Kids About Recycling
We want to make recycling fun and easy for kids. Let’s work together and start educating our young children by joining Ellie and her friends on an adventure to collect 1 million cans. With the help of our mascot Mr. Ferrous Magglio the talking magnet, readers learn that all metal can be recycled. Soon, they will discover that teamwork and the willingness to share and adapt can help them achieve their goals.

This is the perfect book for your child to learn about recycling, financial literacy, perseverance, sharing, teamwork, and donating. Use it as a tool to inspire children’s excitement for and interest in recycling. After kids read the book, watch the recycling lightbulb turn on in their minds as they start looking for cans to recycle.
The Million Cans Recycling Program
But recycling isn’t just for kids — we want to make it easy for anyone to recycle any type of metal. To do this, we started the Million Cans Recycling Program. We are working with scrap yards around the U.S. to bring roll-off bins to local schools so that communities have an easy drop-off location for metal. All metal has value and any proceeds from the recycled metal will go to the school to buy supplies. By making recycling metal easy for everyone, we can achieve our goal of 100% of used metal being recycled by the year 2052.

Help Us Recycle 1 Million Cans
You can be a part of this important environmental initiative by helping us get our book into as many kids’ hands as possible. We’re asking you to buy The Girl Who Recycled 1 Million Cans for the kids in your life — or donate it to elementary schools in your neighborhood. Help us spread the word that metal does not belong in the garbage.
Together, we can save the planet, one can at a time. And you can get a start by searching Earth911’s Recycling Locator to find local metal recycling options (just add your ZIP code when you arrive).

Recycling Mystery: K-Cups & Other Coffee Pods,"There’s no doubt that single-serve coffee makers are downright convenient. Java drinkers can make just one cup of coffee to their exact liking while their housemates, office mates, or clients can make coffee (or tea, hot chocolate, chai) to their own personal tastes. No more arguments over how dark or light or which flavor to brew the community coffee pot. The major downside to a single-serve coffee maker is the plastic pod that remains after you make the coffee. There are many brands of single-serving coffee makers on the market and a few different types of little pods that hold that delightful, personal, single-serving of coffee grounds. Unfortunately, that single-use coffee pod is very hard to recycle.
This article contains affiliate links. If you purchase an item through one of these links, we receive a small commission that helps fund our Recycling Directory.
Keurig’s Efforts
Keurig was one of the first single-serving coffee makers on the market (if not the very first). The company knows that the waste from its disposable K-Cup coffee pods is a problem and wants to do better. So they’ve made some changes to make K-Cups recyclable. Keurig now makes K-Cups from polypropylene, identified by the #5 plastic resin code. Unfortunately, since 2018, when China stopped accepting contaminated recycling from the U.S. (and other countries), polypropylene is not recycled in all municipalities.
In addition, the small size of the pods presents a problem for the machines at the material recovery facilities (MRFs) that sort your recycling to send to recyclers. Commonly, MRFs can’t accept items smaller than single-serving yogurt cups because smaller items can jam the machinery and disrupt operations. While Keurig released a new “Easy-peel” lid to make the #5 plastic pods easier to recycle, not all pods have these lids, which consumers must separate from the pods before recycling (MRFs are not equipped to do this).
K-Cup and Pod Recycling
If you’re a Nespresso drinker, there’s good news: The company offers free recycling of their aluminum capsules. Simply take your capsules to a designated collection point at a Nespresso retailer or ship them back to the company using the Nespresso-UPS recycling program.
For other brands, the news is less rosy. There is a slight possibility that local recycling systems will accept single-use pods. Ask directly and specifically at your local recycling center or municipal waste hauler. Before recycling, be sure to take apart the pods — the Recycle-A-Cup cutter can make it a bit easier. Once separated, recycle the #5 plastic cup and aluminum lid — if your local service accepts them, that is. And be sure to compost the coffee grounds and filter.
However, more than likely, if coffee drinkers want to keep using single-serving coffee pods, they’ll need to pay to recycle the waste. Both Keurig and TerraCycle offer mail-in recycling services for a fee. Neither option is cheap and both are marketed to corporate users, not individual households. Both services will separate the materials, recycle the plastic and aluminum components, and compost the coffee (or tea) grounds and the filter.
Compostable Pods
Compostable coffee pods seem like a more sustainable option, at least on initial consideration. Unfortunately, compostable pods require a commercial composting service and are unlikely to break down in a backyard compost bin. Yet even if you have access to a commercial composting service, this may not be the best option as most commercial operations in the U.S. are not equipped to process compostable packaging. Never put these in your commercial compost bin unless you have confirmed that your local provider accepts them. Putting the wrong materials in the bin will disrupt the composting operation.
Reusable Pods
Another option is to purchase reusable coffee pods, such as the Keurig My K-Cup. There are multiple models of reusable pods on the market for the many different brands of single-cup coffee makers (look into highly reviewed Perfect Pod or JavaJig along with a measuring scoop). Java drinkers simply fill the pods with ground coffee and insert the filled pod into the machine to make their brew. There’s just the extra step to clean out the pod for reuse.
Beyond the Pod: Greener Coffee-Making Options
If you’re looking for a new way to make your daily morning pick-me-up without coffee pod waste, ditch the Keurig (well, give it away or recycle it) and consider one of these options. A reusable pour-over filter is waste-free, easily brews just one cup, and is likely the most affordable choice. A French Press has built-in metal filters and is extremely durable. Drip coffee makers use either reusable metal filters or paper filters that are usually easy to compost in a backyard compost bin. And the old-school school percolators last forever, no filter waste involved, just dump the grounds in the compost.

Is Shredded Paper Recyclable?,"Here at Earth911, we’re often asked, “Is shredded paper recyclable?” The answer is, “Yes, but … .”
Paper consists of fibers. The longer the fiber, the more valuable the paper is during the recycling process. As paper is recycled over and over, the fibers become shorter and therefore less valuable. Eventually, it must be downcycled into tissue or toilet paper.
Shredding the paper speeds up this process. Once you shred your personal documents, it shortens the fibers and lowers the grade of paper from high grade to mixed grade. Mixed grade paper is still recyclable, but you may have a harder time finding a recycler who will take it.
Because it must be contained during transportation, shredded paper usually isn’t accepted in curbside recycling programs. However, it’s worth checking with your local program. They may accept shredded paper if it’s contained in a recyclable paper bag.
If you can’t recycle it curbside, all is not lost. When communities hold e-cycling events, document destruction is often included, so check with your local recycling center or household hazardous waste facility to see if they’ll accept shredded paper at the next e-cycling event.
Or simply use Earth911 Recycling Search and enter your ZIP code to find a recycling location near you.
And before shredding your paper, think about why you need to shred it. Are there are just a few lines of information that you want to keep protected? Then try using whiteout or ink to conceal the information. Ink and whiteout don’t affect the recycling process.
Paper is also compostable, so if you must shred your paper, try mixing it with your compost pile — of course, this is best with nontoxic inks.

Recycling Mystery: Car Seats,"Kids grow so fast. No sooner have parents painstakingly researched and safely installed their infant’s car seat, than it’s time to do it all over again for the next size up. Most children will use three different types of car seats before they outgrow car seats altogether.
That adds up to a lot of car seats. Over 12 million car seats get disposed of each year in the U.S. But rather than ending up in the landfills, or worse, being incinerated, can car seats be recycled? Let’s look at the challenges and opportunities for reducing this waste stream.
When To Dispose of Car Seats
There are several reasons that people need to dispose of car seats.

The car seat has been recalled for safety reasons.
Children have outgrown their car seats.
The car seat has expired.
The car seat has been in an accident.

If the car seat is no longer safe, such as one that is expired or has been in an accident, recycling it is the best choice.
Obstacles to Recycling Car Seats
The greatest obstacle to recycling car seats is the lack of reliable information. Parents just don’t know where to go to recycle their unwanted, but still usable, car seats.
Heather Trim, executive director of Zero Waste Washington, notes there are other challenges as well. Most notable is the fact that plastics recycling in the U.S. became exponentially harder in 2018. That year, China banned the import of nearly all plastics to their country for recycling. Where once there was a strong market for the raw materials of recyclable plastic, now there were few options.
In 2015, Zero Waste Washington launched a program called Old Car Seat, New Life. The program set out to increase the rate of car seat recycling, in part by making it easier for parents to find accurate information. They compiled a list of options for parents looking to recycle their children’s car seats. Unfortunately, since China’s ban on imported plastic recyclables, nothing is a guarantee. Their website recommends calling ahead to any of their listed agencies, as availability changes. Washington state itself has only one company that offers periodic recycling events for paying customers.
Trim points to some lesser-known challenges to keeping car seats out of landfills. One is that there is no reliable way for an untrained person to determine whether a car seat has been in an accident. Without that information, car seats that could be reused or donated end up getting tossed. Another difficulty is that the fabrics in car seats are often treated with flame retardants, posing health risks to workers involved in the recycling process. (There is an effort to remove flame retardants due to the health risks posed to children.)
Where to Donate Used Car Seats
If a car seat hasn’t been recalled, expired, or been in an accident — and is still in good shape, donating it to someone who can use it is the best choice. Unfortunately, as mentioned, not everyone is qualified to inspect child car seats for safety. That’s why many charitable organizations won’t accept car seats. The website safeconvertiblecarseats.com has a list of organizations in all 50 states that accept used, non-expired car seats for donation. The listed organizations include children’s hospitals, shelters for families in crisis, and agencies supporting foster families.
Car Seat Recycling Options
There are options for recycling children’s car seats. Not all of them are convenient, or free, but we’ll try to simplify some of your options here.
Start with your local trash hauler or municipal offices
Most trash haulers offer recycling services as part of their services. It’s a long shot, but give them a call and ask if they accept car seats. They may host sporadic recycling events or be able to point you in the right direction. Your local board of health or department of public works may know of places for you to bring car seats for recycling. There is usually a fee for these options.
Retail store recycling events
Some retailers host car seat recycling events that are good for the planet, good for parents, and good for their businesses. The drop-off is free to parents, and the store may provide a rebate for a future purchase. The retailers benefit from increased foot traffic.
Target held a two-week car seat recycling event in April 2021. Customers (with a Target Circle account) who brought a car seat to recycle received 20% off select baby items. Since 2016, Target has collected a total of over a million car seats for recycling at their events. It’s likely they will continue their event in 2022.
Walmart partnered with TerraCycle to launch their first Walmart Car Seat Recycling Event in September 2019. They had to close the event early after receiving over 1 million car seats in less than a week. Parents who brought a car seat for recycling received a $30 gift card to spend in-store. Walmart has not held a second event, most likely due to COVD-19 precautions.
Mail-in programs
If you have a car seat made by Clek Inc., they offer a mail-in program in partnership with CarSeatRecycling, which also recycles any brand car seat for between $35.99 and $49.99. CarSeatRecycling also offers $10 or 10% off of a future purchase of a Clek product. If you’re going to buy one of their car seats anyway, that discount can offset the recycling fee. CarSeatRecycling, which has recycled more than a half-million car seats, also offers bulk recycling to retailers and for local events.
Another mail-in option, if you have a Century brand car seat, is TerraCycle’s Century Baby Gear Recycling Program. Although this program is free of charge, only Century brand car seats are eligible.
Parents Want to Recycle Children’s Products
It’s clear from the turnout at retail recycling events that parents are highly motivated to see their car seats recycled instead of going to waste in a landfill. After all, we buy car seats to protect our kids. We want to protect the earth for their future, too.

How Clean Must Your Recyclables Be?,"If you’ve taken up recycling, you’re already helping to make the world a greener place. But there are some essential tricks of the trade. A very common concern in the recycling realm is knowing how clean recyclables must be before you throw them in the bin.
Contaminants can ruin certain recycling processes, but do you really have to rinse all the sour cream out of the container before recycling? Is it different for each type of recyclable?
While guidelines vary by location, here’s a basic guide to help you determine the standard of cleanliness for your recyclables.
Rinse Jars, Bottles, and Cans
As a general rule, for things like bottles and jars, a quick rinse is more than adequate. You don’t need to scrub the remains in the mayonnaise jar with soap before recycling, and a few spots won’t likely hinder the process.
For most items, just fill the container with water and vigorously swish the water around inside. (Or better yet, use leftover dishwashing water just before you drain it.) If the residue is sticky like jelly or honey, you may need to use a scrub brush or scraper to remove more of the product.
If you have mixed recycling, be sure to let these items dry out before you put them in the bin with your other recyclables.
Cardboard and Paper Guidelines
Note that grease and oil make cardboard and paper unrecyclable, so pizza boxes covered in grease aren’t fit for the recycling bin. However, if the box is mostly clean with just a few specks of grease, you’re fine to recycle it. (Update: A 2020 study found that some grease in a pizza box does not negatively affect the recycled fiber. As a result, some municipalities will now accept pizza boxes for recycling. Please follow your local recycling guidelines.)
The same goes for other contaminants. If you’re making pancakes and a drop of egg lands on the box, it’s still clean enough to recycle. However, too much of a mess will make it impossible to recycle. Same for wet and moldy paper. Make sure that all of the paper and cardboard in your recycling is dry and relatively clean.
Additionally, crumpled, torn, or misshapen paper and cardboard can be recycled the same as flat products. However, paper that has been shredded or torn into bits shouldn’t go directly into your recycling bin. Not only could it easily blow away and cause littering, but it would also make a mess at the material recovery facility where they sort your recyclables. Check with your recycling provider for local guidelines on shredded paper. It may not be accepted for recycling curbside or you may need to put the shredded paper inside a paper bag before placing it into your recycling bin.
Shake Clean Plastic Bags
Plastic bags and film should be dry and clean of residue. Again, a few particles, such as bread crumbs, left in the plastic bag will not hinder the recycling process. In most cases, you can simply shake out bags before recycling them. This will easily take care of dry particles inside the bag.
If there is sticky film or residue, such as peanut butter or mustard stuck to a sandwich bag, wash it out. After washing any plastic bags, make sure that the bags are dried completely before recycling, as excess water can interfere with the melting process during recycling.
Note that in most cases, you cannot put plastic bags and plastic film in your curbside bin as they will jam the machinery at the recycling facility. However, you can find bins to drop off your plastic bags for recycling in many supermarkets and big-box stores. As always, please check your local recycling guidelines.
Throw Away Heavily Soiled Items
Unfortunately, some items cannot be recycled and should simply be thrown away. Any items that are heavily soiled or impossible to clean cannot be recycled.
It’s very important to sort your recycling correctly and make the process as simple as possible for your city. If you need more information about the proper way to recycle products, contact your local recycling facility.

Why and How To Recycle Your Old Mobile Phone,"Is your cellphone contract about to expire? If so, your carrier will likely allow you a free or cheap upgrade if you turn in the old phone for recycling. Sending a trade-in device at the end of a mobile contract is the easiest and most common way that people recycle their old phones. If your old cellphone is so damaged that it can’t be repaired for someone else to use, your carrier might not accept it for a trade-up, but you should still recycle it.
Phone manufacturers and various third-party organizations provide financial incentives for recycling old phones. Some limit your recycling to one device in exchange for a new device, but others allow you to sell multiple phones.
Let’s take a look at why that’s important and how you go about recycling your old phone.
Why Go to the Trouble of Recycling an Old Phone?
It might seem like garbage to you, but your old phone contains valuable materials. And if it’s not properly disposed of, it’s a potential danger to you and the environment. Consider these reasons it’s important to recycle your cellphone in the first place.
Harmful Materials
There are many kinds of materials inside cellphones that are quite dangerous to humans, animals, and plants.
For example, mobile devices contain mercury, which has long been known to cause brain damage, muscular disorders, and other medical issues. Lead is another common element in phones. It can cause cancer and brain damage. There are more, but those are the two most dangerous materials. A qualified recycler will know how to handle the harmful materials in the phone safely.
Conserving Resources
It only makes sense that if you recycle a phone, the materials can be put to good use. The gold, solder, and silicon in a phone can be recovered and used again. Some materials, such as the rare earth elements used in electronics, are only available from China and could be cut off in the case of conflict. If your phone is inoperable, a qualified recycler can recover some of its plastic, metal, and rare earth elements. If it still functions, you’ll be preventing the need to produce another one, which saves valuable natural resources.
Waste Reduction
If you take good care of your phone, you can turn it in and reduce the amount of waste entering the ecosystem. This, alone, is a good reason to recycle an old phone.
Money in Your Pocket
Consider the money you save when you turn in a working phone for a new one. Not only do you get a spiffy new cellphone, but you get a cash discount on it. Some sellers even give consumers a cash bonus for turning in an old phone. So, in addition to all the environmental and safety reasons for recycling a phone, you can get a nice financial reward too.

Just Do It! How To Recycle Your Old Phone
There are two steps to recycling an old phone. If it’s damaged beyond repair, as in a fire or flood, you can simply drop it at a local recycling center that accepts electronic devices and be done with it. You can enter your ZIP code in the Earth911 Recycling Search tool to find a location near you.
But, if you’re like most people and intend to trade in your functioning cellphone for an upgrade, you’ll need to prep it first to ensure your data is secure. Then you can safely give it to your vendor, knowing that none of your sensitive data is still on it.
Here’s how to prep your old phone before turning it in for recycling — or for refurbishing and resale to another consumer:

Clean it thoroughly: Don’t use cleaners that contain ammonia, which most window cleaners contain. Use alcohol instead.
Completely back up your data: Check your phone’s manual online and follow the exact procedure for backing up data.
Perform a proper reset: Do a factory reset, which will eliminate about 95% of all the personal information on the phone.
Take the SD and SIM cards out: Remove all SIM, SD memory, and other cards that you may have added to the phone for additional memory or capabilities.
Write down the model number: If you don’t know your model number, call your carrier.
Test basic functions: Is everything working? Check the backlight, charging ports, volume control, touchscreen, power button, camera, and whether there are dead pixels on the screen.
Turn in for recycling or refurbishing: Tell the organization you give your phone to about its general condition. They’ll usually test the basic functions to make sure it’s in good shape. If it isn’t, simply tell them to recycle it. If it’s in decent shape, be sure they give you credit for a trade-in or trade-up on your account.

Where To Trade In or Recycle Your Phone for Cash
The following phone manufacturers offer trade-in programs that provide credit toward a new mobile device:

Samsung
Apple
Google
And, if you buy from Amazon, they also offer trade-in deals.

Most mobile carriers offer generous trade-in values if you are considering a new phone:

AT&T
Sprint
Verizon
T-Mobile
US Cellular

And a variety of companies buy old phones to recover the materials they contain or resell them, often overseas:

GadgetGone
NextWorth
ItsWorthMore
MaxBack
Buyback Boss
Gadget Salvation

You can also take your old phones to Staples, Office Depot, and Best Buy to drop them off for recycling. It’s always a good idea to call first and confirm.
A Word of Caution
Don’t store old phones long-term in your home or office. Unused cell phones and batteries can become dangerous if exposed to temperature extremes or moisture, potentially exposing you and others to harmful substances. Be safe and take your old phone directly to a local recycler, which usually includes your carrier’s store, as soon as you get a new phone.

If it still functions, you’ll be preventing the need to produce another one, which saves valuable natural resources. Waste Reduction If you take good care of your phone, you can turn it in and reduce the amount of waste entering the ecosystem. This, alone, is a good reason to recycle an old phone. Money in Your Pocket Consider the money you save when you turn in a working phone for a new one. Not only do you get a spiffy new cellphone, but you get a cash discount on it. Some sellers even give consumers a cash bonus for turning in an old phone. So, in addition to all the environmental and safety reasons for recycling a phone, you can get a nice financial reward too. Photo: Ashkan Forousan, Unsplash Just Do It! How To Recycle Your Old Phone There are two steps to recycling an old phone. If it’s damaged beyond repair, as in a fire or flood, you can simply drop it at a local recycling center that accepts electronic devices and be done with it. You can enter your ZIP code in the Earth911 Recycling Search tool to find a location near you. But, if you’re like most people and intend to trade in your functioning cellphone for an upgrade, you’ll need to prep it first to ensure your data is secure. Then you can safely give it to your vendor, knowing that none of your sensitive data is still on it. Here’s how to prep your old phone before turning it in for recycling — or for refurbishing and resale to another consumer: Clean it thoroughly: Don’t use cleaners that contain ammonia, which most window cleaners contain. Use alcohol instead. Completely back up your data: Check your phone’s manual online and follow the exact procedure for backing up data. Perform a proper reset: Do a factory reset, which will eliminate about 95% of all the personal information on the phone. Take the SD and SIM cards out: Remove all SIM, SD memory, and other cards that you may have added to the phone for additional memory or capabilities. Write down the model number: If you don’t know your model number, call your carrier. Test basic functions: Is everything working? Check the backlight, charging ports, volume control, touchscreen, power button, camera, and whether there are dead pixels on the screen. Turn in for recycling or refurbishing: Tell the organization you give your phone to about its general condition. They’ll usually test the basic functions to make sure it’s in good shape. If it isn’t, simply tell them to recycle it. If it’s in decent shape, be sure they give you credit for a trade-in or trade-up on your account. Where To Trade In or Recycle Your Phone for Cash The following phone manufacturers offer trade-in programs that provide credit toward a new mobile device: Samsung Apple Google And, if you buy from Amazon, they also offer trade-in deals. Most mobile carriers offer generous trade-in values if you are considering a new phone: AT&T Sprint Verizon T-Mobile US Cellular And a variety of companies buy old phones to recover the materials they contain or resell them, often overseas: GadgetGone NextWorth ItsWorthMore MaxBack Buyback Boss Gadget Salvation You can also take your old phones to Staples, Office Depot, and Best Buy to drop them off for recycling. It’s always a good idea to call first and confirm. A Word of Caution Don’t store old phones long-term in your home or office. Unused cell phones and batteries can become dangerous if exposed to temperature extremes or moisture, potentially exposing you and others to harmful substances. Be safe and take your old phone directly to a local recycler, which usually includes your carrier’s store, as soon as you get a new phone.

Recycling Mystery: Patio Furniture,"Sitting outside year after year, through the blazing summer sun and the freezing winters, patio furniture has to endure a wide array of extreme conditions. Sooner or later, it’s going to wear out. But can you recycle your old patio furniture? Well, that depends on the materials used to make it.
Recycling Patio Furniture by Material
Patio furniture is made from a variety of materials, each with its own recycling options — or frustrations. While metal outdoor furniture is easy to recycle, plastic furniture is far more challenging. Wood furniture, on the other hand, simply isn’t recyclable if it’s been painted or sealed to protect it from the elements. Below, we’ll investigate these more in depth.
As with all recycling mysteries, we need to include one important note: If your furniture is still in usable condition, consider selling it or giving it away. Most donation centers that accept furniture will also accept patio furniture. You can also use Facebook garage sale groups or apps like Letgo and OfferUp to find a new home for your usable furniture.

Plastic Patio Furniture
There’s a good chance you’ll find a resin identification code somewhere on your plastic furniture. Look for a little triangle with a number in it. The code indicates what type of plastic your furniture is made from. Most plastic furniture will be made from plastic number 5 or number 2. Due to the size and shape, it’s unlikely your curbside recycling program will accept these items. However, if you have a larger recycling facility in your area, they may accept them, so be sure to give them a call. To search for a recycler in your area, you can use Earth911 Recycling Search — just enter your ZIP code.
Unfortunately, if your local recycling facility doesn’t accept plastic furniture, you don’t have many recycling options. TerraCycle has an outdoor furnishings zero waste pallet you can purchase. You’ll then be able to ship the furniture to them for recycling (be sure to fill it only with the materials they designate). However, this option is quite expensive.
Some plastic furniture can be refinished, so that is an option to extend its life. These step-by-step instructions from WikiHow show you how to paint plastic furniture.

Metal Patio Furniture
Metal patio furniture is both durable and easily recyclable. Most metal furniture is made from aluminum, steel, or wrought iron. While your local recycler is unlikely to accept furniture in your curbside bin, your city probably has at least one scrap yard that will accept your old metal furniture. Just visit the Earth911 Recycling Search and search by the type of metal.
Not sure what kind of metal your furniture is? Use a magnet to determine if it’s a ferrous or nonferrous metal (ferrous metals attract a magnet; nonferrous don’t). Then, search for ferrous metals or nonferrous metals with our Recycling Search tool. Be sure to call the facility before you make the trip to verify they will accept your specific items.
Wood Patio Furniture
Unfortunately, wood outdoor furniture isn’t recyclable. Since it’s usually treated with some type of varnish or sealer, it can’t be composted either. You still have some options. You can refinish it, repair it if broken, or break it down and reuse the good pieces to make something new. If it’s too broken or rotten for any of those options, you’ll have to throw it away.
You can significantly extend the life of your outdoor furniture with regular maintenance and care. Photo: silverstrike24, Pixabay
Maintaining Your Patio Furniture
While outdoor furniture will eventually need to be replaced, you can significantly extend its life with proper maintenance and care. Regularly cleaning your furniture is a good first step. When using soap to clean furniture, stick to mild detergents and read instructions/warnings carefully. Some soaps can discolor the furniture.
Also, during the seasons when you aren’t using your patio furniture much, it’s a good idea to store it inside or under an overhang to limit exposure to the elements. You may also want to consider buying patio furniture covers, which, when used regularly, can dramatically lengthen the life of your outdoor furniture.
Editor’s Note: This article was originally published on February 27, 2019 and updated in August 2021. Got a question about how to recycle as specific product or type of material? Let us know, and we’ll do the research, sharing the results with the world.

Home Battery Recycling Guide,"Americans purchase billions of batteries every year to power toys, cell phones, clocks, watches, laptops, portable power tools, rechargeable vacuums, radios, smoke detectors, remote controls, and so much more. When they no longer hold their charge, it’s always a good idea to recycle them – and in some cases, it’s the law. This guide reviews common battery types you use at home and how to recycle them.
Battery recycling is on the rise. According to Call2Recycle — which runs the United States’ largest battery recycling program — battery recycling was up 11% in 2020 with 8.4 million pounds of consumer batteries recycled, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
It’s important to recycle batteries to reclaim useful materials. Depending on the battery type, it may contain mercury, lead, cadmium, nickel, silver, cobalt, lithium, or graphite. Many of these materials can be harmful if they are not disposed of properly, so recycling batteries serves the dual purpose of preserving finite resources and protecting the environment.
Unless your local recycling service tells you otherwise, don’t put your batteries in your curbside recycling — they can create a hazard. You need to take them to a separate location for recycling. You can use Earth911’s recycling search tool or Call2Recycle’s recycling search locator to find a battery recycling location near you.
Single-use Batteries
Alkaline single-use batteries
Standard single-use batteries include AA, AAA, D, 9-volt, 6-volt, and so forth. They power the household electronics you use every day, such as the TV remote control, toys, flashlights, and so much more.
Pros: Single-use batteries are produced on a greater scale than rechargeable batteries, making them initially cheaper to purchase. They are also prevalent and widely available.
Cons: Single-use batteries are generally considered more wasteful because we use them up and then throw them away when the power is depleted. And because they’re not rechargeable, we need to have extra batteries around at all times in case the battery powering an essential gadget dies.
How to recycle: Your local solid waste department may tell you to put alkaline batteries in with your regular trash. This is partly due to the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act passed in 1996, which phased out the use of mercury in alkaline batteries, making them less of a hazard when disposed of in landfills. According to Call2Recycle, “there is currently no national stewardship solution to allow for free recycling of single-use batteries, except in Vermont.” But this doesn’t mean alkaline batteries are not recyclable.
A number of national chains collect these batteries for recycling, including Batteries Plus and Home Depot, and your local hardware store may accept them for a fee. Always call first to confirm your local store accepts these battery types. If you’re unable to find a local recycling option through the Earth911 recycling database, consider mail-in recycling programs such as those offered by Call2Recycle or The Big Green Box.
Button cell batteries

The flat, round batteries that power small items like watches, car keyless entry remotes, hearing aids, and fitness trackers are called button cell batteries or button batteries. Previously, these batteries were commonly made with silver, cadmium, or mercury. Today, most button batteries contain lithium. It’s important to recycle these batteries because these metals are a limited valuable resource and can be hazardous if not handled properly.
Pros: Button cells are increasingly targeted for recycling because of the value of recoverable materials, their small size, and their easy handling relative to other battery types.
Cons: Don’t let the size fool you. Even tiny batteries that contain mercury, silver, cadmium, or lithium can be hazardous and should not be crushed or overheated. In addition, these small, shiny discs appeal to children and can be harmful or fatal if swallowed or stuck in a child’s nose or ear — keep them away from small children.
How to recycle: For some items, such as a high-end watch, a professional will replace these batteries, so ask the business if it will recycle the battery for you. For other items, like hearing aid batteries or car remote batteries, the doctor’s office or car dealership may have a recycling program. You can also search for a local solution through Earth911’s recycling search tool. Otherwise, consider mail-in recycling programs such as those offered by Call2Recycle or The Big Green Box. Finally, these batteries may be accepted for disposal through household hazardous waste (HHW) collection programs sponsored by your solid waste district or municipality. Find an HHW disposal location near you — just enter your ZIP code.
Rechargeable Batteries
Rechargeable household electronics
Rechargeable batteries are becoming more prevalent in cordless products such as cordless vacuums, toothbrushes, and power tools.
Pros: Because rechargeable batteries can be used over and over again, they can save consumers money over the life of each battery. Also, due to the Battery Act of 1996, providing easy ways for the public to recycle these batteries is mandated by law.
Cons: Rechargeables are more expensive upfront and sometimes get a bad rap for not offering enough “bang” for your buck. They also contain a lot of heavy metals, meaning that if you don’t recycle them, contamination to the environment is much more likely.
How to recycle: More than half of the states in the U.S. have laws in effect that require that state battery recycling in effect and/or require manufacturers to support those efforts. If you live in an area that’s not covered by such laws, Call2Recycle is a great place to start your recycling search. Through Call2Recycle’s program, retailers such as Alltel, AT&T, Best Buy, Black & Decker, DeWalt, The Home Depot, Interstate All Battery Centers, Lowe’s, Milwaukee Electrical Tool, Office Depot, Orchard Supply, Porter Cable Service Centers, RadioShack, Remington Product Company, Sears, Staples, Target, US Cellular, and Verizon Wireless all offer some sort of rechargeable battery recycling program.
The nickel from these types of batteries can be recycled into flatware, pots and pans, golf clubs, or new batteries.
Cellphones, laptops, and other portable electronics
Li-ion battery in cellphone. Photo by Tyler Lastovich from Pexels
Lithium-ion or lithium-ion polymer (Li-ion) batteries are commonly found in cell phones and other portable consumer electronics.
Pros: Lithium-ion batteries are recyclable, and the metal content of these batteries can be recovered in the recycling process. These batteries can be recharged before they are completely discharged without affecting the energy capacity. Li-ion batteries are smaller, lighter, and provide more energy than older battery types used for portable devices.
Cons: Li-ion batteries should never be sent to a landfill because they have the potential to overheat and explode when exposed to hot temperatures or compressed.
How to recycle: You will more than likely dispose of a Li-ion battery along with an electronic device, such as when you trade in your cellphone or upgrade a laptop. In most cases, the company that handles your electronic device will accept the battery as well. Call2Recycle’s program also covers these batteries, so finding recycling locations shouldn’t be a challenge.
Frequently, these types of batteries can be refurbished and reused. Lithium-ion batteries can also be broken down into steel and stainless steel components.

What Happens to E-waste When It Gets Recycled?,"Worldwide, electronic waste makes up more than 5% of all municipal solid waste. Commonly called “e-waste,” these discarded electronic products often end up in the landfill — but they shouldn’t. Some of these items can be repaired or reused if still functional. If they are irreparably broken, the e-waste should be recycled to reclaim reusable materials.
Cell phones, computers, TVs, DVD players, stereos, and printers are among the most common electronic products that can be refurbished or recycled. Others include microwaves, refrigerators, air conditioners, lamps, toys, video-game consoles, and power tools.
Recycling e-waste recovers useful materials — including valuable metals such as gold or copper — that manufacturers can use to make new products. This reduces the energy required to mine, refine, and manufacture new materials and reduces pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that by recycling 1 million cell phones, some 35,000 pounds of copper, 33 pounds of palladium, 772 pounds of silver, and 75 pounds of gold can be recovered.
However, current estimates show that only about 15% to 20% of all e-waste is recycled internationally. In the United States, the average rate of recycling e-waste is a bit higher, approaching 25%. However, most electronic waste still ends up in landfills or gets incinerated, wasting useful resources and releasing toxic chemicals and other pollutants — such as lead, mercury, and cadmium — into the soil, groundwater, and atmosphere to the detriment of the environment.
So, what exactly happens to e-waste when it’s recycled?
Exporting E-waste
In 2016, almost 45 million tons of e-waste were produced globally. According to reports from the United Nations, the United States produces 14% (more than 6 million tons) of the world’s e-waste. Of the e-waste that is recycled, much of it is first shipped abroad to separate the usable parts and extract the metals for reuse in new products.
For recycling firms in the United States or Europe, it is often cheaper to have the labor needed to pull apart and melt e-waste outsourced to developing nations such as China or India. Therefore, at present, some 50% to 80% of e-waste collected by recyclers is “exported.” The UN reported that China is the number one destination for exported e-waste, noting that an estimated 70% of the world’s e-waste ends up there.
Hazards of Electronic Recycling
The handling of hazardous and/or toxic materials poses significant potential health risks to workers employed in processing e-waste. Specifically, processes such as dismantling components, chemical processing, and incineration may all produce direct exposure to, and inhalation of, dangerous substances. One such common hazard is exposure to lead and other toxic metals. Another example of hazardous substance encountered in electronic recycling is mercury, which can be a dangerous neurotoxin.
If facilities lack adequate safety protocols, there is a constant risk of exposure to hazardous substances to workers as well as nearby communities. For example, the burning of wiring and cables increases the concentration of dioxins — toxins known to increase the risk of cancer if inhaled by workers or nearby residents. Likewise, dioxins can contribute to general air pollution.
In some developing nations, the people who work at these jobs have very limited economic opportunities. So, despite the health risks, the recycling industry is a welcome opportunity for employment.
How E-waste Is Processed
E-waste recycling is largely a process of separating plastics from metals and internal circuitry. Efficiency in this separation of materials is the foundation of economically viable electronics recycling because the e-waste stream must be processed in a way that separates commodities that can be used to make new products. As a result, the usual first step in e-waste processing is mechanically shredding products into tiny pieces.
Specific recycling processes vary depending on the materials being recycled and the technologies used, but there are some common steps. For example, at the recycling facility, workers may separate iron and steel from the waste stream on a conveyor belt with a powerful overhead magnet that lifts off the iron and steel so it can be prepared for resale as recycled steel.
Further mechanical processing separates aluminum, copper, and circuit boards. This leaves the material stream as mostly plastic. Often, water separation technology is then used to separate glass from plastics. The final step is locating and extracting any remaining metal from the plastics to further filter the material stream. The separated materials are prepared for sale as usable raw materials for the production of new electronics or other products.
The Economics of E-waste Recycling
IBISWorld estimated the revenue generated by the U.S. electronics recycling industry to reach almost $15 billion in 2019. Although the quantity of e-waste is growing fast, the quality of e-waste may be declining. Devices are becoming smaller and smaller, and therefore use fewer precious metals. In turn, the value of materials in many electrical devices has fallen drastically. Slumping global prices paid for recycled commodities have decreased profit margins and hurt electronics recyclers. Another obstacle is that many newer products are manufactured in ways that make it more difficult to recycle, repair, or reuse them.
At this time, 25 U.S. states have laws requiring statewide e-waste recycling. According to the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, several more states are working toward passing new legislation affecting their existing policy. State e-waste recycling laws purportedly affect some 65% of Americans. Not to mention, in some states, the chief alternative to e-waste recycling — dumping electronic waste in landfills — is banned entirely.

E-Waste: What Happens When We Fail To Recycle Electronics,"Today, the average person owns three to four electronic devices. But what happens after these devices become obsolete and replaced?
The unfortunate reality is that a majority go into the trash can, generating e-waste. It may be the easiest option at the time, but it can cause more harm than many realize. When disposed of with regular garbage, e-waste is highly dangerous due to the toxic elements released.
Let’s look at what happens when electronic devices are not properly recycled.
1. Impact on the Soil
After you throw out your e-waste, its next destination is often the landfill.
E-waste can take thousands of years to decompose. During that time, it has a damaging and long-lasting effect on the environment. As electronics break down, they release toxic chemicals into the soil, contaminating plants and trees. Some of these chemicals include lead from circuit boards and lithium from batteries. They also have the potential to make their way into human and animal food supplies.
2. Groundwater Damage
Improper disposal of e-waste can lead to toxins — including mercury, lead, and cadmium — flowing into the groundwater.
Groundwater makes its way to streams, ponds, and lakes, which are sources of water for animals, plants, and humans. Contaminated water poses the risk of compromising the food chain and can contribute to numerous health risks including reproductive and developmental problems, cancer, and immune system damage.
3. Air Pollution
When e-waste isn’t recycled, it’s often burned in incinerators. Burning electronics may seem like a good solution to get rid of e-waste but it’s actually harmful.
Electronics are composed of plastics, glass, and metals, which produce dangerous emissions when burnt. Such emissions don’t just pose direct damage to animals and humans, they also result in an increased rate of ozone depletion and greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming and climate change.
4. Marine Pollution
If your trash doesn’t find itself in landfills or face the furnace, the ocean is another likely dumping area.
Millions of tons of trash, including e-waste, goes into the ocean every year. Since electronics are non-biodegradable, marine dumping is not better than any other of the options. The result of marine dumping can be deadly to organisms, disturb biodiversity, and harm ecosystems. In some situations, the presence of e-waste and associated toxins can damage ecosystems to the point where recovery is questionable, if not impossible.
Why Should You Recycle Electronics?
Besides taking care of the environment and minimizing health hazards, many reasons exist for electronics recycling. A few of them are:

Data security: Proper electronics recycling takes care of the data on your computer or smartphone so it doesn’t end up in the wrong hands.
Precious metals: It’s possible to melt down and reuse old devices to manufacture other products, thus saving the planet’s resources. If Americans recycled the phones they throw out every year, they could save enough energy to power 24,000 homes.
Other users: Your old electronic device is likely to function for another year or two. Help give a second life to your old device.
The law: In some states like New York and California, it’s illegal to dispose of electronics with your trash.
Save money: Some companies allow you to trade in your old device for a discount on a new one.
Simplicity: Today, numerous ways to recycle electronics exist. You don’t need to go out of your way to help save the planet.

Saving the Planet: How to Recycle Electronics
Contributing to the planet’s safety has never been easier. When you need to get rid of an electronic device, you have several options.
1. Take it to the Recycler
Find out which organizations in your community help with recycling old electronics. Take advantage of online sources like Earth911 Recycling Search or Call2Recycle to locate nearby options.
2. Bring Your Electronics to a Tech Company
Some electronics manufacturers and retailers have set up recycling and trade-in programs. You can recycle your old electronics and often receive discounts on a new purchase.
3. Give to Charity
If your device is still in working condition, you can give it to a charity or nonprofit organization in your area. Make sure to get a receipt. As a bonus, you may qualify for a deduction on your next year’s tax return.
Growing Problem
As the number of electronic devices manufactured every year soars, the e-waste problem grows. Even though people tend to hold on to their phones and electronics a little longer than they used to, the turnover of such devices is still huge.
The more e-waste is generated, the larger a toll it takes on the environment and health, locally and around the world.
In the current world of technology, recycling should be an everyday practice. Educate yourself on the necessary recycling procedures for your electronic waste to create a long-lasting change.

The next minute, they can’t stand the idea of them, opting for toy cars instead. As kids grow up, parents often find themselves with lots of unwanted plastic toys to dispose of. And toy recycling options are limited.
Most toys are difficult to recycle, especially if they’re made up of tiny plastic parts that can’t be easily separated. Municipal recycling programs don’t typically accept plastic toys; recyclers often accept only specific shapes and sizes of plastics. The best hope is to find a takeback program through the toy manufacturer or retailer.
Mattel PlayBack
One of the largest toy makers in the world, Mattel, Inc., recently launched their own toy takeback program. Called Mattel PlayBack, the program is designed to recover and reuse materials derived from old Mattel toys to make new products. By participating in the program, families give new life to their unwanted Mattel brand toys, diverting waste from the landfill.
Currently, Mattel PlayBack accepts Barbie, Matchbox, and MEGA toys in the United States and Canada. The company says it hopes to expand it to France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in the near future. They also plan to add toys from all of their other brands, like Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price. For now, though, the company recommends donating those ineligible toys to other children as long as they’re in relatively good condition.
How To Participate
Similar to Lego’s Replay program, which they launched in 2019, Mattel’s PlayBack program provides free prepaid shipping labels to interested participants after they fill out a brief form with contact information and the like. But unlike the Lego program, which diverts waste from the landfill by cleaning the toy bricks and donating them to charities or schools, Mattel promises to recycle or reuse the collected toys in their own future products.
Participating in Mattel’s takeback program is remarkably easy and the process won’t cost you a dime. When it comes time to pass on your child’s used Barbie, Matchbox, or MEGA toys, return them to Mattel instead of tossing them in the trash. Their condition doesn’t matter and you won’t need to clean or repair them before mailing them in.
Head to the company’s website and fill out a brief form. Then, you’ll be provided with a free, printable prepaid shipping label for your toys. Grab an old cardboard box and package your toys (use newspapers for cushioning if needed). If the toy has batteries, remove and recycle them separately.
After your package is prepped, slap on the shipping label, drop it off at the post office. You’ve successfully diverted your plastic toys from a landfill where they could have sat for hundreds of years leaching harmful chemicals into the soil and groundwater.
How Donated Toys Are Recycled
Once Mattel receives your old toys in the mail, they will sort and separate them by material. The company promises to recycle them and reuse their components in new toy products whenever possible.
If it’s not possible to recycle or reuse them due to outdated or damaged components, the company will either downcycle the materials into other plastic products or convert them from waste to energy.
While the company doesn’t delve into the recycling details, it’s likely the process will be similar to that of other plastic recycling programs. This involves sorting, shredding, and melting the plastic so it can be fashioned into something new.
Mattel’s Sustainability Goals
Mattel has a big sustainability goal — going waste-free by using circular design principles. First, they design their products to last, so they can be passed on from kid to kid and easily repaired when needed. And the company is conscious about the materials they use and says they aim to recycle and reuse them when possible, incorporating old materials into new toys.
Their current primary goal is to rely on 100% recycled, recyclable, or bio-based plastic materials in their products and packaging by 2030. And by the end of 2020, they’re on track to achieve 95% recycled or Forest Stewardship Council-certified content in the paper and wood fiber they use in packaging and products.
Mattel introduced several toys to support this goal in 2020. This includes two Fisher-Price baby toys made from plastic derived from sugarcane, three MEGA Bloks sets made from bio-based plastics, and the first fully recyclable UNO deck without cellophane packing materials.
What About Other Toy Brands?
Mattel’s PlayBack toy recycling program accepts only Mattel brand toys. If you have other toys to recycle, TerraCycle partners with different manufacturers to offer free recycling for their products. Currently, TerraCycle offers free recycling for all Hasbro brand toys and games, Spin Master toys and games, L.O.L. Surprise products and packaging, and VTech and LeapFrog electronic toys and learning devices. TerraCycle also offers for-purchase recycling solutions for toys, action figures, and stuffed animals.
If your kids’ toys are still in working condition, please pass them along to other children who can enjoy them, as you can do with unwanted Lego bricks through the Lego Replay program.

Recycling Mystery: Toothbrushes & Toothpaste Tubes,"Oral care products, such as toothbrushes and toothpaste tubes, may seem impossible to recycle. After all, how would a recycler remove all of that extra toothpaste from the tube or disassemble a toothbrush for recycling? Let’s take a closer look at this recycling mystery to get the low-down on keeping our pearly whites healthy without contributing to landfill waste.
This article contains affiliate links. If you purchase an item through one of these links, we receive a small commission that helps fund our Recycling Directory.
Can I Recycle Toothbrushes and Toothpaste Tubes?
Answer: Yes. But probably not all types through your local recycling program. Read on to learn your options.
How Are Oral Care Products Recycled?
Oral care products and packaging vary greatly by material and can include different types of plastics, aluminum, steel, and nylon. In most cases, each of these components must be processed separately, making it a tricky job for recyclers.
Toothbrushes
“Toothbrushes are one of the most complicated items that we collect for recycling across the board, simply because they’re made up of three different components,” said Stacey Krauss, U.S. public relations manager for TerraCycle, which accepts toothbrushes and oral care product packaging through its mail-back Oral Care Recycling Program.
“There are the nylon bristles, there’s a metal staple that holds the bristles in place, and then there’s the plastic handle. So, all three of those materials need to be separated before they can be processed,” she explained.
After toothbrush components are separated, metals are processed through standard recycling. The nylon and plastic components are shredded, cleaned, and pelletized for use in manufacturing items ranging from picnic tables and benches to playground equipment and bike racks, among other things, Krauss said.
Toothpaste Tubes
The sticky residue inevitably left inside toothpaste tubes makes these picks seem like another head-scratcher, but they’re actually much easier to recycle than you’d think, TerraCycle’s lead scientist, Ernie Simpson, told Earth911.
“For bottles, toothpaste tubes, or anything like that, one of the tricks for getting residuals out of these containers is to shred the material,” Simpson said. “Once the materials are shredded, the surface area that has the residuals is exposed.”
After toothpaste tubes are shredded, they pass through a washing cycle where the pieces are cleaned with water or a simple biocide, a solution that dissolves bio-based materials. After cleaning, shredded tubes are dried and enter a pelletizing step, where recycled materials are converted into pellets for use in new products.
Similar shredding and pelletizing processes are used for salvaging mouthwash containers and dental floss packaging for recycling, Simpson said.
Oral Care Products Mail-in Recycling Programs
If you use Preserve brand toothbrushes, Gimme 5 hosts a Preserve Toothbrush Takeback program: For every six Preserve toothbrushes that you send for recycling, they’ll give you a $6 coupon for Preserve’s online store.
Through TerraCycle’s free Oral Care Recycling Program, consumers can fill a box with any brand of toothbrushes, toothpaste tubes and caps, toothpaste cartons, toothbrush outer packaging, and floss containers and mail it back to TerraCycle for recycling. For each shipment over 5 pounds, you’ll earn TerraCycle points that can be redeemed for cash donations to the school or nonprofit organization of your choice.
Can I Recycle Oral Care Packaging Locally?
Recycling rules vary by region, so check with your local recycling provider if you have any doubts. If their recycling guidance doesn’t list toothbrushes, floss containers, toothpaste tubes, or another item you hope to recycle, ask them if they can process it. Putting materials in your curbside bin that your program doesn’t accept can end up contaminating your other recyclables.
Toothpaste Tubes
Toothpaste tubes are often made with a combination of different plastics and a thin layer of aluminum. This mix of materials makes them hard to recycle and it is unlikely they are accepted through your curbside recycling pickup. However, that may change. In 2019, Colgate started transitioning to toothpaste tubes made of recyclable #2 plastic (HDPE), and other brands are not far behind.
Although the transition to recyclable tubes is not complete, if you have this type of toothpaste tube, you may be able to recycle it. If the tube has the #2 (HDPE) recycling code on it, check with your local recycler to confirm they are prepared to process #2 plastic toothpaste tubes before putting them in your curbside bin. You may be instructed to drop off the material at a collection center.

Mouthwash Bottles
You may be able to recycle other forms of oral care packaging such as mouthwash bottles through your local curbside recycling program. After emptying and rinsing your containers, check on the bottom for the plastic recycling code. Once you know what kind of material you’re dealing with, check with your local recycler or use Earth911 Recycling Search to search for recycling options near you.
Precycle Your Oral Care Products
While recycling options exist for many types of oral care product packaging, you’ll make disposal much easier for yourself by choosing easy-to-recycle products and packaging ahead of time (aka precycling).
For toothbrushes, consider switching to a model with a replaceable head to minimize waste. Rather than tossing an entire toothbrush every three months, simply replace the head and continue using the handle for months to come. Most replaceable head models, like these from Eco-Dent and Radius (which uses recycled materials in the handle), cost about the same as conventional toothbrushes. Or, consider bamboo toothbrushes as an alternative to plastic.
To take the guesswork out of toothbrush disposal, you can also sign up for a toothbrush subscription with Preserve, an upcycling company that makes toothbrushes and other products from recycled #5 plastics. Through the subscription, you pick how frequently you want to receive your new toothbrush (every one to three months). Your Preserve toothbrushes are recyclable through Preserve’s mail-in recycling program. This is a small taste of the circular economy, in which all waste is recycled.
When choosing your toothpaste, consider a brand that offers a take-back program for tubes and packaging, such as Tom’s of Maine. If you want to skip the toothpaste tubes, consider a tooth powder, such as Eco-Dent’s DailyCare, or a toothpaste tablet, such as WELdental Chewtab. Or, do a little research before you shop to find a company that notes packaging materials on its website to make finding a recycling solution easier.
Make Your Own Toothpaste
If you’re feeling ambitious, you can also make your own toothpaste at home from natural ingredients, eliminating packaging waste entirely. Check out these homemade toothpaste recipes from Instructables, DIY Natural, and Crunchy Betty to get you started. Since different mouths have different needs, talk to your dentist before making the switch to a homemade toothpaste to make sure the recipe you chose is right for you.

Recycling Mystery: Plastic Shower Curtains,"If your shower has a plastic curtain or liner, has it seen better days? If so, you may be wondering if you can recycle it. It might seem like you could recycle this big sheet of plastic like you do plastic bottles and grocery bags — but you probably can’t.
Let’s look at how you might recycle your plastic shower curtain. We’ll also consider some better options to take its place and some ways you can reuse that old shower curtain to extend its useful life.
Shower Curtain Recycling?
It’s very unlikely that you can recycle your worn-out shower curtain in your curbside bin or at a drop-off location. Most plastic shower curtains or plastic shower curtain liners are made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as plastic #3, which is generally not recyclable in municipal recycling systems. This is unfortunate since PVC is so durable and the third most used variety of plastic.
Do not treat plastic shower curtains like film plastic and try to recycle them at a store drop-off location. Your shower curtain is made from a different polymer.
TerraCycle, a company that believes that nearly everything can be recycled, accepts shower curtains for recycling in their Bathroom Accessories Zero Waste Box. TerraCycle asks customers to purchase a box from them, fill it, and then mail the full box back to them (shipping cost included in box purchase cost). This solution isn’t cheap, starting at $118 as of early 2021, but you can include bath toys, pumices, soap dispensers, soap dishes, bath mats, bathtub safety rails, and showerheads — all of which are also hard to recycle. TerraCycle offers many other Zero Waste Boxes for specific rooms and items.
Make Your Replacement Shower Curtain Greener
Since you are considering how to get rid of a worn-out shower curtain, you are probably also looking for a replacement. There are more eco-friendly alternatives.
The best advice is to first select a shower curtain that is washable and more durable than a PVC curtain. Ideally, your next shower curtain will last longer and not need to be thrown away when it’s past its usefulness. There are many polyester cloth shower curtains on the market that you can safely machine wash over and over. Because these curtains are made of cloth, they could potentially be recycled with fabric at the end of their life.
If you’d rather not continue to use a plastic-based shower curtain even if it is fabric, you might consider a 100% cotton or hemp curtain. When it’s past its useful life, you could potentially cut it up and compost it, but you’d want to try a small piece first. These curtains don’t require a liner, but if you can’t live without a liner for your cotton or hemp curtain, avoid the PVC by getting a machine washable polyester liner that would last as long as a polyester shower curtain.
Alternately, eliminate the shower curtain completely and install a shower screen or shower door on your tub. More costly, these long-term installations are very durable and washable. They will eventually also need to be landfilled or upcycled, but the timeline is in decades, not single years like the life of plastic shower curtains.
No matter which kind of shower curtain or door you land on, do your best to help it last longer. Wash it regularly to prevent mold and mildew. Keep your bathroom well ventilated. You may even manually dry it off between showers.
Uses for Worn-out Plastic Shower Curtains
If your shower curtain is no longer usable for its initial purpose, it probably still has value for other uses. Consider your plastic shower curtain a small tarp that’s easier to cut than the conventional outdoor, blue tarps. Here are a few ideas to get your mind churning on how you can use this big piece of plastic:

Dropcloth for interior painting
Table cover for messy DIY or craft projects
Protect your car seats under kids’ booster seats
Similarly, protect the back seat vehicle floor against kid’s shoes and general mess
Line your vehicle’s trunk
Liner under the cat’s litter box
Liner for inside the cabinet under kitchen sink
Cut your shower curtain into same-sized pieces and sew them together to make waterproof bags to carry wet swimsuits, reusable feminine products, cloth diapers, etc.
Cut into strips and duct tape together to make a DIY slip n slide
Fold in half and seal the ends, then fill with hose water, and let your little kids jump around on a “water blob” outside in the sun
When camping, use it to protect firewood from rain, as a waterproof tablecloth, a tent tarp, or to divide food in the cooler

If you need something lined, protected, kept dry  — this is your material to use!

Can Face Masks Be Recycled?,"There is not a lot of data about how much waste the use of face masks is generating in the U.S. But according to one estimate, if everyone in the U.K. used a disposable mask each day for a year, it would create 66,000 metric tons of contaminated waste and 57,000 metric tons of plastic packaging waste.
Greenpeace Taiwan estimates that during a 14-week period of 2020, Taiwan used roughly 1.3 billion surgical masks. If the global population uses one disposable face mask per day, we’d dispose of 129 billion face masks each month.
A Better Option
Already, some people are working on finding new uses for old masks and developing biodegradable masks. Abaca, a biodegradable fiber from banana plants, has shown promise as a potential replacement for polyester and plastics in medical masks. An eco-entrepreneur in India is working to convert disposable masks into construction bricks. And a company called Plaxtil is upcycling used PPE into new PPE.
But for now, the best most of us can do to reduce pandemic-related waste is to wear reusable cloth masks whenever possible.
Cloth Masks
According to the University College of London, machine-washing reusable masks is the most eco-friendly masking strategy. But even reusable cloth masks eventually wear out. Especially if you are following the CDC washing recommendations, masks will shrink or start coming apart at the seams. According to the World Health Organization, you should not wear a cloth mask that looks damaged, doesn’t fit properly, is wet or dirty, or has been worn by others.
Some epidemiologists recommend replacing them seasonally as a precaution. It’s a good idea to check your masks for tears or damage each time they come out of the wash.

Mixed Messages
Since most people have been wearing cloth masks for less than a year, most of us haven’t worn them out yet, so people are just beginning to think about what to do when they are no longer usable. The World Health Organization says, “When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.” But they do not have recommendations on the disposal of cloth masks. Neither does the CDC.
Like pandemic safety, pandemic waste is being handled differently in different places, and the guidelines are changing frequently. Check with your local solid waste utility to find out if they have specific disposal guidelines for cloth masks. So far, most of them don’t.
Recycling
Like underwear, face masks are a secondhand clothing item that most people don’t want no matter how thoroughly they’ve been washed. And because they involve a lot of seams in a small amount of fabric, it’s not easy to disassemble masks for upcycling or crafts.
In some communities, like San Jose, Calif., cloth masks are accepted for recycling with other textiles. However, textile recycling is not available everywhere. Even many communities that do offer textile recycling consider face masks a health risk and do not accept them. If your community accepts cloth masks for textile recycling, be sure to wash your old masks in hot water first.
Disposal Don’ts
As many as 1.5 billion face masks (of any kind) may enter marine ecosystems in the year 2021.
Like other ocean pollution, masks can release microplastics or be eaten by wildlife. Littering is always a bad idea, but simply discarding an old mask outdoors is also a potential health hazard. If the mask has been exposed to viral particles, anyone who tries to clean up after you risks exposure. Similarly, you should not dispose of used masks (cloth or disposable) in open trash bins.
Littering is always a bad idea, but littering a used mask is also a potential health hazard.
Disposal Do’s
In the absence of official guidelines, many people would like to err on the side of precaution. If you are one of them, and you have access to medical waste disposal, you can treat your used masks as medical waste. Medical waste is usually incinerated. Sometimes it is sterilized before rejoining the regular waste stream. A second option may be to treat your used masks as household hazardous waste (HHW). However, few communities have the infrastructure or funding to manage used masks as HHW.
For most people, disposal in regular garbage is the only option. In this case, consider your old masks comparable to a used tissue or Band-Aid. Seal the mask in a small bag before putting it in the garbage bin, even if you have washed or stored it for 72 hours first. That way, if your garbage bag tears, your neighbors and garbage collector won’t have to worry about potential exposure.
Reusable cloth masks don’t work for you? If you must use disposable face masks, learn how the EcoBreathe recyclable mask helps reduce waste.

How To Recycle organicgirl Salad Greens Clamshell Packaging,"Featured product: organicgirl good clean greens are delivered in 5 oz., 10 oz., and 16 oz. plastic #1 clamshell containers.

Recycling Steps
If your curbside program accepts #1 plastic clamshells:

Wash the clamshell, removing any organic material.
You can soak labels to remove the paper and leave the remaining adhesive on the package or cut the plastic with labels attached off the clamshell to minimize contamination.
Dry the container.
Place the clamshell packaging directly in the recycling bin. Do not bag your plastic recyclables, they will be pulled from the waste stream and sent directly to a landfill.
You’re done, and you made a difference. The recycling center will separate your clamshells from other types of plastic, wash them (again), and shred them before melting them into a resin. The end product is plastic pellets that can be used to make new products.


If you drop #1 plastic clamshells at a transfer station:

Find a recycling transfer station near you.
Wash the clamshell, removing any organic material.
You can soak labels to remove the paper and leave the remaining adhesive on the package or cut the plastic with labels attached off the clamshell to minimize contamination.
Dry the container.

When you arrive at the transfer station, place your clamshells into the appropriate bin. Do not use a plastic bag, place them in the bin separately.
You are done! Your extra work makes a difference!

#1 Plastic Explained
#1 Plastic clamshell packaging is common across the United States and is accepted by many local recycling programs in and around major metropolitan areas. Although most recycling programs accept #1 Plastic bottles, some may not accept molded clamshell containers because they are currently incompatible with their recycling systems.
Sustainability Benefits of Recycling organicgirl Clamshell Packaging

Recycling a Plastic #1 clamshells reduces the amount of energy and carbon dioxide emitted during production by at least 30 percent. Organicgirl clamshell containers come with a built-in sustainability boost. Each package is made from recycled plastic bottles.
Recycling one pound of organicgirl 5 oz. containers, which is 8.60 clamshells of 1.86 ounces each, reduces the power required to produce another pound of plastic by approximately 3.35 kilowatt-hours, eliminates about one pound of CO2 emissions, and saves almost 2.5 gallons of water used in the manufacturing process.
At that rate, if you ate salad every day and recycled the containers, you would reduce the energy required to make the packaging by 174-kilowatt hours a year. Your carbon footprint would fall by about 52 pounds annually and the water used to make the containers would decline by 130 gallons a year.
Add that up across the country and we’re talking about a meaningful impact. These small steps add up.
Data source: Eco-profiles of the European plastics industry
organicgirl’s Ongoing Packaging Efforts
Organicgirl continues to explore better packaging options. It introduced its salad greens in a biodegradable Polyactic acid (PLA) bioplastic container. But the company found that there were not enough industrial composting facilities in the U.S. to reliably process a large share of the PLA. Customers asked for a change, as well, and organicgirl switched to its current recycled PET clamshell package.
organicgirl is working with its clamshell packaging provider and Earth911 to identify the gaps in the recyclability of their clamshells. This information will be helpful in directing industry and community programs working to close those gaps. Organicgirl is also investigating new labeling options that could remove the adhesive and paper contamination created by labels. We will update this guide when new labeling is available.

  Why You Should Ditch Antiperspirant: 6 Natural Deodorants That Work 
  Can Face Masks Be Recycled?","Featured product: organicgirl good clean greens are delivered in 5 oz., 10 oz., and 16 oz. plastic #1 clamshell containers. Recycling Steps If your curbside program accepts #1 plastic clamshells: Wash the clamshell, removing any organic material. You can soak labels to remove the paper and leave the remaining adhesive on the package or cut the plastic with labels attached off the clamshell to minimize contamination. Dry the container. Place the clamshell packaging directly in the recycling bin. Do not bag your plastic recyclables, they will be pulled from the waste stream and sent directly to a landfill. You’re done, and you made a difference. The recycling center will separate your clamshells from other types of plastic, wash them (again), and shred them before melting them into a resin. The end product is plastic pellets that can be used to make new products. If you drop #1 plastic clamshells at a transfer station: Find a recycling transfer station near you. Wash the clamshell, removing any organic material. You can soak labels to remove the paper and leave the remaining adhesive on the package or cut the plastic with labels attached off the clamshell to minimize contamination. Dry the container. When you arrive at the transfer station, place your clamshells into the appropriate bin. Do not use a plastic bag, place them in the bin separately. You are done! Your extra work makes a difference! #1 Plastic Explained #1 Plastic clamshell packaging is common across the United States and is accepted by many local recycling programs in and around major metropolitan areas. Although most recycling programs accept #1 Plastic bottles, some may not accept molded clamshell containers because they are currently incompatible with their recycling systems. Sustainability Benefits of Recycling organicgirl Clamshell Packaging Recycling a Plastic #1 clamshells reduces the amount of energy and carbon dioxide emitted during production by at least 30 percent. Organicgirl clamshell containers come with a built-in sustainability boost. Each package is made from recycled plastic bottles. Recycling one pound of organicgirl 5 oz. containers, which is 8.60 clamshells of 1.86 ounces each, reduces the power required to produce another pound of plastic by approximately 3.35 kilowatt-hours, eliminates about one pound of CO2 emissions, and saves almost 2.5 gallons of water used in the manufacturing process. At that rate, if you ate salad every day and recycled the containers, you would reduce the energy required to make the packaging by 174-kilowatt hours a year. Your carbon footprint would fall by about 52 pounds annually and the water used to make the containers would decline by 130 gallons a year. Add that up across the country and we’re talking about a meaningful impact. These small steps add up. Data source: Eco-profiles of the European plastics industry organicgirl’s Ongoing Packaging Efforts Organicgirl continues to explore better packaging options. It introduced its salad greens in a biodegradable Polyactic acid (PLA) bioplastic container. But the company found that there were not enough industrial composting facilities in the U.S. to reliably process a large share of the PLA. Customers asked for a change, as well, and organicgirl switched to its current recycled PET clamshell package. organicgirl is working with its clamshell packaging provider and Earth911 to identify the gaps in the recyclability of their clamshells. This information will be helpful in directing industry and community programs working to close those gaps. Organicgirl is also investigating new labeling options that could remove the adhesive and paper contamination created by labels. We will update this guide when new labeling is available.

"Bioplastics, Biodegradable Plastics, & Compostable Plastics: What’s the Difference?","The global bioplastic market is growing rapidly. Bioplastics, biodegradable plastics, and compostable plastics divert our demand for plastic and help lighten the load on our planet by, theoretically, breaking down in weeks rather than centuries. It’s an important step forward for single-use packaging, but we still encourage you to look for plastic-free options.
Let’s dig into the realities of biodegradable plastics. Despite high hopes for these alternatives to help build a circular economy, there seems to be a lot of confusion regarding how to dispose of them properly at their end of life. Do you know the difference between these bioplastics?
Bioplastics Cover a Wide Ground
A wide range of materials falls under the umbrella of bioplastics, which are commonly defined as “biobased, biodegradable, or both.”
It might surprise you to know that a bioplastic can be non-biodegradable or contain no bio-based materials. It can even be 100% fossil-based. To complicate matters, a bioplastic “can be any combination of being partially bio-based, fully bio-based, non-bio-based, biodegradable, compostable or non-biodegradable, so long as it is not both non-bio-based and non-biodegradable.”
Let’s break it down a little further, shall we?
What Are Bioplastics?
Plastic that is fossil fuel-based and non-biodegradable is what we know as conventional plastic. It takes centuries for most of these plastics to breakdown in the environment, and oil-derived plastics leave toxic byproducts in the soil or water. But if  a plastic is biobased and biodegradable or biobased and non-biodegradable, it can be classed as a bioplastic.
Image source: European Bioplastics
Bioplastics are commonly made of corn starch, cassava, or sugarcane. They provide an alternative to petroleum-based plastic and decompose faster and with fewer leftover toxins. But the idea that these plant-based plastics are natural carries with it big misconceptions. These plant-based plastics’ biomass content releases methane as it decomposes and they act like conventional plastics in the ocean, degrading into microplastics and harming marine life that mistakes it for food.
How do you recycle or dispose of bioplastics? Right now, many products in this category are labeled as Plastic #7 (or mixed). They will contaminate waste streams if put into the curbside recycling bin in almost all locations in the U.S. Check the packaging, call your municipality, and browse TerraCycle for alternative recycling programs, but if no one accepts it, you have to toss it. Placing #7 plastic in your recycling bin can ruin plastic recycling processes at the materials recovery facility (MRF) that receives it.
Long-term, we need a stronger infrastructure to collect bioplastics and industrial composting facilities to close the loop. Like so much of our recycling infrastructure, plastic recycling is stuck in the late 20th Century.
What Is Biodegradable Plastic?
The term “biodegradable” can also mislead consumers because the process of breaking down the material in a compost pile depends heavily on humidity and temperature. Many plastics that carry this claim will only biodegrade in industrial conditions that reach hot enough temperatures. A few cities, such as San Francisco and Seattle, have invested to ensure their compost programs achieve industrial temperatures, but the vast majority have not. This highlights the need for caution about what you choose to recycle.
There are many types of biodegradable plastics, but the most common are starch-based polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). PLA can “look and behave like polyethylene (used in plastic films, packing, and bottles), polystyrene (plastic foam and plastic cutlery), or polypropylene (packaging, auto parts, textiles)” while PHA is created by microorganisms that produce plastic from carbon-rich organic material and is used in industrial applications, such as making injection-molded auto parts.
Oxodegradable plastics, or conventional petroleum-based plastics with additives that help them break down faster, are another subset of biodegradable plastics. California is the only state with labeling laws to keep the terms separate.
How do you recycle or dispose of biodegradable plastics? Contact your municipality to ask if they are eligible for local composting programs, consider TerraCycle’s Zero Waste Box for biodegradable or compostable plastic, or throw them away.
What Is Compostable Plastic?
Compostable plastics are another subset of biodegradable plastics, but while all compostable plastics are biodegradable, not all biodegradable plastics are compostable. While many consumers think they can compost these products at home, that’s not the case; they most often require industrial composting facilities to break them down. Most compostable plastics are biobased and designed to break down within three to six months in an industrial composting facility.
Unfortunately, this confusion can lead to littering. While compostable plastics have a smaller carbon footprint, they don’t solve our throwaway culture.
How do you recycle or dispose of compostable plastics? Sadly, you can’t compost them. Like biodegradable plastics, compostable plastics do not necessarily break down in all commercial composting facilities. Talk to your municipality about existing or planned composting facilities that can process compostable plastics. Or consider TerraCycle’s option for compostable plastic.
For Now, Treat Bioplastics as Plastic
The reality is, we are creating bioplastics faster than the infrastructure we need for their safe, circular disposal — and multinational brands must lead the way on clear, transparent labeling to educate consumers. Until we establish an end-of-life solution for bioplastics, they’ll end up in landfills or polluting waterways the same as conventional plastic.
That’s why it might be helpful to think of them — for now — as exactly that: plastic. Cut down your plastic use to make the biggest positive impact on the planet.

How To Recycle Your Old Cookware,"There are numerous reasons to dispose of old cookware. You may have upgraded to a new model, the cooking surface may have eroded over time, or perhaps you are merging kitchen supplies with a new roommate or partner. For some items, recycling your old cookware is an option, but there are a few variables to consider first.
Can Your Cookware Be Reused?
If you need to dispose of pots and pans, the first option to consider is reuse. Sites like Craigslist and Freecycle are good options for finding your cookware a new home, as are secondhand stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army. A few scratches or dings may matter to you, but that doesn’t make your pots and pans unusable.
Where Can You Recycle Your Cookware?
For pots and pans that have seen better days, recycling is an option, but likely not your curbside bin. Unless your curbside recycling program accepts scrap metal (only about 5% of the curbside programs in Earth911’s recycling directory fit this description), recycling will take a little more effort.
Most cookware is going to have some portion of metal, and for recycling purposes, you’ll want to know whether it is ferrous or nonferrous metal. Your pots and pans are most likely nonferrous metal, made from aluminum, copper, or stainless steel. If they attract a magnet, though, they are ferrous metal. This matters because some recyclers only accept either ferrous or nonferrous metal.

If you have nonstick cookware that’s coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (or PTFE — what you may know by the DuPont brand name Teflon), recycling options are limited. The coating needs to be removed before the pan can be recycled. Once you’ve found a scrap metal recycling near you, call them to ask if they accept Teflon-coated pans.
What About Non-Metal Cookware?
Some cookware will have no metal component, such as ceramic bowls or Pyrex baking dishes. Don’t put these items in your curbside bin. They cannot be recycled with your glass containers, and putting them in the bin will contaminate your recyclable items.
Pyrex is a type of treated glass that will not melt at the same temperature as glass bottles and jars during the recycling process. If mixed with container glass, it would make the resulting material unusable. Unfortunately, there are few recycling options at this time for non-container glass.
Can You Recycle Cooking Utensils?
Just like cookware, if the items are still usable, see if you can find them a new home. If they’re broken or otherwise unusable, responsible disposal depends on the material:

Wood: You can likely cut, break, or saw your old wooden spoons into small pieces for composting — be sure to remove any plastic pieces first.
Metal: These items offer the same reuse and recycling options as metal cookware.
Plastic: Reuse is your best option for plastic utensils as recycling is problematic. For starters, you’re unlikely to know what type of resin they are made of, which is the first step to determine the recyclability of plastics. Check with your local recycling program; it’s likely you cannot put them in your curbside bin and will need to just put these items in the trash.

"Wow, You Can Recycle That?","We hear all the time about recycling plastic bottles and aluminum cans, but what about some of the lesser mentioned items? In response to reader queries, we’ve assembled a list of some odd items that may have you saying, “Wow, you can recycle that?”
Blue Jeans
You know the regular routine. When you no longer need, like, or fit into your jeans, you can always donate them to a charitable resale organization like Goodwill or The Salvation Army.
You’ve heard it a million times, so let’s not make it a million-and-one. We’re actually talking about physically recycling your jeans. After all, some clothes are just too far worn or damaged to head to a resale shop and deserve a proper [recycling] burial.
Enter pioneering companies like Blue Jeans Go Green and Bonded Logic, which manufacture insulation products from recycled denim and cotton fibers. Blue Jeans Go Green offers a variety of denim recycling options through selected retailer dropoff locations, mail-in programs, and denim drives.
Yup, your old denin can become insulation! Photo: Flickr/suttonhoo
Automotive Fluids
Are you a DIYer when it comes to car care? Many of the fluids that power your car are actually recyclable once you change them out, most notably used motor oil and antifreeze.
Used motor oil can be re-refined into brand-new products that can go back into your car, recycled into clean lubricants, or burned as fuel. As long as the used oil hasn’t been contaminated with other fluids, most oil change service companies or auto parts stores accept used motor oil for recycling from the public.
Used antifreeze can also be recycled by filtering out contaminants such as lead, then restoring the original properties through stabilizing additives. The recycled product is not only excellent quality, but it can also be less expensive to purchase and has a smaller carbon footprint. Antifreeze should never be left out or dumped as its sweet taste can poison animals and children.
Snack Wrappers, Drink Pouches, & Chip Bags
Any idea what material candy wrappers, drink pouches, and chip bags are made of? If you answered “no,” you’re not alone as this is a common question we get asked a lot. This confusion is usually what makes these wrappers and bags so difficult to recycle. These items tend to be made of mixed materials, making the recovery of useful plastics and other materials difficult and expensive. In other words, most recyclers don’t want to touch the stuff!
But TerraCycle, a company dedicated to eliminating the idea of waste, has a recycling solution. You can recycle wrappers from candy, chips, granola bars, gum, and other snacks through their Candy and Snack Wrappers Zero Waste Box. Just order the box, save up your empty snack wrappers, and send it back to TerraCycle with the prepaid return label. Note that there is a fee for this recycling solution. (Check TerraCycle’s free recycling solutions for other waste streams.)
Cooking Oil
Cooking oil recycling has grown leaps and bounds in the last few years as its value to the biofuel industry has increased. While it may seem natural to pour your leftover cooking oil and grease down the drain, it can actually be harmful to wildlife and the environment and damage your pipes and local sewage systems. In fact, cooking oil and kitchen grease in our plumbing is the No. 1 cause of stopped-up sewer pipes.
Commercial facilities already contribute substantial amounts of used oil to alternative fuel programs, but there are household cooking oil recycling programs as well. Make a designated waste oil container, label it, and add to it each time there is leftover oil from your cooking. Then search for a local recycling location with Earth911 Recycling Search or contact local restaurants to see if they accept the cooking oil for recycling.
Six-Pack Beverage Rings
Those plastic six-pack beverage rings have definitely received their share of criticism over the years. Like so many plastic packaging materials, they are often disposed of carelessly, polluting public spaces and waterways and endangering wildlife.
The rings are made of plastic #4 (LDPE) and can be recycled in programs that accept low-density polyethylene resin. If your curbside recycling program is limited to plastics #1 and #2 or limits the types of LDPE accepted, consider getting a group collection together and participating in the Hi-Cone Ring Leader Recycling Program.
Hi-Cone’s Ringleader program will accept the six-pack rings in large quantities for recycling through various school programs, as well as through the mail. The company has worked with more than 12,000 schools and groups to collected and recycle the used rings.

Gift Cards, Hotel Key Cards, & Other Plastic Cards
A five-minute clean-out of your wallet, purse, or junk drawer is likely to yield a lot of plastic, from used gift cards to old library cards. Insignificant as they may seem, those cards are typically made of a plastic resin called polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is infinitely recyclable. Yet it’s most often landfilled, contributing to more than 75 million pounds of PVC entering the waste stream each year.
Although you likely can’t recycle these cards in your curbside bin, TerraCycle offers a solution for recycling these items with its Plastic Cards Zero Waste Box. Note that there is a fee for this recycling solution. (Check TerraCycle’s free recycling solutions for other waste streams.)
Tennis Balls
Rebounces accepts old tennis balls for recycling and refurbishing. Those brightly colored tennis balls should still be of reasonable quality, and you should wait until you’ve saved up a large amount.
Let Fido have those tennis balls with the teeth holes or slobber on them; they aren’t usually accepted for recycling if not in better condition. Photo: Flickr/TCL8TO7
Ski Equipment
When your skis just aren’t cutting (or carving) it anymore, consider recycling them instead of tossing them. Vermont-based Green Mountain Ski Furniture will convert your old skis into a custom chair, bench, table, rack, or another custom-built piece. What a great way to preserve those memories! Custom orders typically take 10 to 14 weeks for completion.

  Earth911 Reader: Reassessing Environmental Impacts & Evolution Can’t Keep Up With Global Warming 
  Buyer’s Guide: Clothes Dryers","We hear all the time about recycling plastic bottles and aluminum cans, but what about some of the lesser mentioned items? In response to reader queries, we’ve assembled a list of some odd items that may have you saying, “Wow, you can recycle that?” Blue Jeans You know the regular routine. When you no longer need, like, or fit into your jeans, you can always donate them to a charitable resale organization like Goodwill or The Salvation Army. You’ve heard it a million times, so let’s not make it a million-and-one. We’re actually talking about physically recycling your jeans. After all, some clothes are just too far worn or damaged to head to a resale shop and deserve a proper [recycling] burial. Enter pioneering companies like Blue Jeans Go Green and Bonded Logic, which manufacture insulation products from recycled denim and cotton fibers. Blue Jeans Go Green offers a variety of denim recycling options through selected retailer dropoff locations, mail-in programs, and denim drives. Yup, your old denin can become insulation! Photo: Flickr/suttonhoo Automotive Fluids Are you a DIYer when it comes to car care? Many of the fluids that power your car are actually recyclable once you change them out, most notably used motor oil and antifreeze. Used motor oil can be re-refined into brand-new products that can go back into your car, recycled into clean lubricants, or burned as fuel. As long as the used oil hasn’t been contaminated with other fluids, most oil change service companies or auto parts stores accept used motor oil for recycling from the public. Used antifreeze can also be recycled by filtering out contaminants such as lead, then restoring the original properties through stabilizing additives. The recycled product is not only excellent quality, but it can also be less expensive to purchase and has a smaller carbon footprint. Antifreeze should never be left out or dumped as its sweet taste can poison animals and children. Snack Wrappers, Drink Pouches, & Chip Bags Any idea what material candy wrappers, drink pouches, and chip bags are made of? If you answered “no,” you’re not alone as this is a common question we get asked a lot. This confusion is usually what makes these wrappers and bags so difficult to recycle. These items tend to be made of mixed materials, making the recovery of useful plastics and other materials difficult and expensive. In other words, most recyclers don’t want to touch the stuff!

Another Reason to Recycle Cartons — and Other Materials,"Good news to report: The COVID-19 pandemic has not stopped people from recycling. In fact, some people are recycling even more.
According to research conducted by the Carton Council of North America, 56% of consumers say they have been recycling as much as they usually do and almost 29% report they have been recycling more since the pandemic began. This should be celebrated, especially because recycling workers in communities across the country have been working hard to maintain recycling services.
But that’s not the only reason to keep up your recycling. Many people don’t stop to think about the important role recycling plays to provide feedstock – or materials – that can be used to make new products. The shortages of popular paper products such as toilet paper, paper towels, and tissues reinforced the importance of recycling paper. Food and beverage cartons are one example of the materials that can be recycled to help make these staple paper products.
By Recycling, You Help Make New Products
When you recycle your food and beverage cartons, they provide needed feedstock for paper mills to create in-demand paper products. But if you never before thought about this connection, you aren’t alone.
When asked in the same research how much impact recycling at home has on helping with paper shortages, 33% of Americans report it might have some impact, but they aren’t sure how much it really helps. Add to that, 18% feel recycling had no impact at all on alleviating shortages, while 13% are unsure and have not thought about the connection. This translates to six in 10 people do not see recycling as a way to combat paper shortages.
Source: Carton Council
Recycling used materials for new uses extends their lifecycle and contributes to a more sustainable future. By recycling your cartons, you can help to protect our planet’s precious resources, reduce landfill waste, and contribute to the creation of new products.
Food and beverage cartons contain many products you’re familiar with, such as milk, juice, broth, and even wine. They are made mainly of high-quality fiber that is in demand in the recycling stream. For example, at Sustana Fibers in Wisconsin and Great Lakes Tissue in Michigan, food and beverage cartons provide paper feedstock to produce new paper products. Additionally, recycled cartons are also used to make eco-friendly building and construction materials. If cartons end up in a landfill, we lose the opportunity to utilize this material forever.
What You Can Do
Carton recycling is easy. First, check with your local recycling program and make sure cartons are accepted where you live. Some recycling programs have had to temporarily stop or slow service due to the pandemic, so it’s best to check.
If accepted, simply empty your food and beverage cartons of any product and put them in your curbside recycling bin. You don’t need to flatten the cartons and can leave the caps on.
Source: Carton Council
If carton recycling isn’t yet available in your area and you want to get involved, we urge you to sign the pledge to recycle your cartons. By taking the pledge, you will be joining our community of carton recyclers who care about recycling and reducing waste, saving energy, and making a difference in their communities.
If your recycling program currently accepts cartons, please recycle your food and beverage cartons. And don’t forget to tell your friends, family, and co-workers that recycling their cartons provides needed material to make new paper products.

Plastic Bag and Plastic Film Recycling for Beginners,"Ideally, we should avoid single-use plastic bags and plastic film. Failing that, we should reuse them as much as possible. But not all bags are reusable. And most can be reused only so many times before they tear. Plus, plastic wrap and plastic film are near-impossible to reuse around the house. (For the rest of this article, I’ll use the term “plastic bags” to refer to both plastic film and plastic wrap.)
Eco-conscious folks don’t want to put them in the trash, if avoidable — and we certainly don’t want to strew them on the streets or grounds, where they will foul the environment and endanger animals, birds, and fish.
You can, thankfully, recycle many — though not all! — of your plastic bags. But you can’t put them into the same recycling bins where you put paper, cans, bottles, etc.
Putting plastic bags in the wrong bin contaminates the other recyclable materials and can create dangers for recycling workers because the thin plastic film can become tangled in machinery and jam equipment.
Thankfully, grocery stores and big retail stores host collection bins where you can drop off plastic bags for recycling, though these programs were paused due to COVID-19 and, recently, collection bins managed by How2Recycle.info have come under scrutiny for failing to follow through on their recycling promise. Be sure to ask your grocer where the bags they collect are sent.
Numerous organizations help promote responsible plastic bag recycling, through labeling, education, and other efforts. And companies, including Trex, collect and turn bales of collected bags into composite lumber for use in decks, fences, benches, and more, or into smaller pellets that can be used to make crates, shipping pallets, and other objects.
Recyclable Plastic Bags, Wraps, & Film
According to the American Chemical Council’s Plastic Film Recycling site, “Plastic film — also known as plastic film packaging — is soft, flexible polyethylene (PE) packaging such as grocery, bread, zip-top, and dry cleaning bags. It’s also the wrap around many products including paper plates, napkins, bathroom tissue, diapers, and more.”
Some plastic bags are labeled with the plastic resin number used to make it, typically with a “2” or “4” or even a graphic such as How2Recycle’s, shown below. Most of these should be recyclable. For everything else, however, you need to look and think to decide. Some won’t even be plastic!
Some bags may display the How2Recycle label. Source: How2Recycle
Unlike colored plastic containers that create problems for the optical sensors in sorting machinery, color isn’t a concern for consumers recycling their plastic bags, since these bags aren’t machine-sorted. “There are no color limitations on the plastic film that can be recycled at Trex collection locations,” according to Trex.
Examples of plastic bags, wraps, and film that can be recycled, according to Plastic Film Recycling, include:

Retail, carryout, produce, newspaper, bread, and dry cleaning bags (clean, dry, and free of receipts and clothes hangers)
Zip-top food storage bags (clean and dry)
Plastic shipping envelopes (remove labels), bubble wrap, and air pillows (deflate)
Product wrap on cases of water/soda bottles, paper towels, napkins, disposable cups, bathroom tissue, diapers, and female sanitary products
Furniture and electronic wrap
Plastic cereal box liners (but if it tears like paper, do not include)
Any film packaging or bag that has the How2Recycle label

Don’t Include These in Your Plastic-Bags-to-Recycle Pile
Including the wrong stuff defeats the entire purpose of recycling plastic bags. This includes both the wrong bags and the potentially-OK bags that have disqualifying problems.
Recycling rules can vary from city to city, state to state, and even store to store, so do confirm your local recycling requirements.
DO NOT INCLUDE any of the following in your load of plastic bags and film to recycle

Biodegradable or compostable bags. When mixed with other bags, the additives used in these bags can contaminate the plastic produced unusable in new products.
Plastic bags used for packaged frozen foods, which contain food preservatives that contaminate the other recyclable bags in the batch.
Bags that aren’t completely dry: The water interferes with proper processing.
Bags that aren’t completely free of food residue or other contaminants: If there are a few crumbs, you can rinse it clean, and make sure you dry it. But if there’s, say, peanut butter smear, throw it out
Pre-washed salad mix bags
Six-pack rings
Plastic bags, film, or wrap that:

are stiff rather than stretchable – if you can’t poke your thumb into it and feel it stretch, don’t include it
tear like paper
crinkle loudly when you scrunch it up in your hand, for example, candy wrappers, snack bags, or flower bouquet wrap
are silvery or metallic, such potato chip bags and printer ink cartridges bags



Prepping Your Plastic Bags for Recycling
For those bags that can be recycled, take the time to make sure they are clean, dust-free, and dry. Remove any paper labels or stickers; if you can’t peel off a label, cut it off. Be sure to check plastic shopping bags and remove receipts before dropping them in the bin. Remove any zip-lock and hard-plastic slider seals.
Some places may be OK with leaving labels, stickers, and zip tops, but you can’t go wrong by removing them. See Earth911’s “How to Recycle Plastic Bags” for more guidance.
Finding Locations To Recycle Your Plastic Bags
Many supermarkets and other stores have plastic bag recycling drop bins. This includes many, but not all, locations of Home Depot, Lowes, Star Market, Target, Wegmans, and Whole Foods. You can also ask your town/city hall or local recycling department. The local plastic bag recycling guidance should be posted on the collection bin.
Usually, you can find locations near you by doing online look-ups. Start with Earth911’s Recycling Search. Recycling rules and locations are apt to change. So if a listed plastic bag drop-off location isn’t someplace you were going anyway, call first to make sure they still collect plastic bags for recycling. If you find a location has ended its collection bin service, a new location, or that the rules have changed, please tell Earth911 so we can update our listings to help your neighbors.
Once you get the hang of what’s okay and what’s not and have found a store or two where you can drop off your plastic bags, all you need to do is designate a place in your home to accumulate the bags. Then, periodically — probably about once a month — bring them with you to the store. Not hard at all. Your planet, including the ecosystem and its critters, will thank you.

But if there’s, say, peanut butter smear, throw it out Pre-washed salad mix bags Six-pack rings Plastic bags, film, or wrap that: are stiff rather than stretchable – if you can’t poke your thumb into it and feel it stretch, don’t include it tear like paper crinkle loudly when you scrunch it up in your hand, for example, candy wrappers, snack bags, or flower bouquet wrap are silvery or metallic, such potato chip bags and printer ink cartridges bags Prepping Your Plastic Bags for Recycling For those bags that can be recycled, take the time to make sure they are clean, dust-free, and dry. Remove any paper labels or stickers; if you can’t peel off a label, cut it off. Be sure to check plastic shopping bags and remove receipts before dropping them in the bin. Remove any zip-lock and hard-plastic slider seals. Some places may be OK with leaving labels, stickers, and zip tops, but you can’t go wrong by removing them. See Earth911’s “How to Recycle Plastic Bags” for more guidance. Finding Locations To Recycle Your Plastic Bags Many supermarkets and other stores have plastic bag recycling drop bins. This includes many, but not all, locations of Home Depot, Lowes, Star Market, Target, Wegmans, and Whole Foods. You can also ask your town/city hall or local recycling department. The local plastic bag recycling guidance should be posted on the collection bin. Usually, you can find locations near you by doing online look-ups. Start with Earth911’s Recycling Search. Recycling rules and locations are apt to change. So if a listed plastic bag drop-off location isn’t someplace you were going anyway, call first to make sure they still collect plastic bags for recycling. If you find a location has ended its collection bin service, a new location, or that the rules have changed, please tell Earth911 so we can update our listings to help your neighbors. Once you get the hang of what’s okay and what’s not and have found a store or two where you can drop off your plastic bags, all you need to do is designate a place in your home to accumulate the bags. Then, periodically — probably about once a month — bring them with you to the store. Not hard at all. Your planet, including the ecosystem and its critters, will thank you.

How To Recycle a Broken Treadmill,"If you have a home gym, it’s likely you own a treadmill. Too often, this kind of gym equipment goes unrecycled.
Whether you use it regularly or not, your treadmill will eventually stop working. When it is beyond repair, it’s possible to recycle many part of a treadmill.
First, you’ll need to take your treadmill apart. It’s a good idea to find a few rugged boxes to collect and separate all of the pieces and parts. The only tool you need in most cases is a drill to remove screws. There’s no science to it: Just start unscrewing screws and your running machine will come apart.
You’ll end up with five major categories of waste once your treadmill is in pieces on the floor: metal, the running belt, the running board, electronics, and hard plastic pieces.
Metal to Scrap
Exercise equipment has many metal components. You’ll end up with metal support pieces, tiny screws, and, assuming your treadmill isn’t manual, the big motor that makes the whole thing work.
You can either recycle the metal at your local scrap yard or enlist someone to do so for you. Post on social media or electronic/traditional wanted ads that you have metal for scrap and you will surely attract a few people interested in taking your metal. Don’t expect a windfall of money from your scrap and don’t charge your scrap metal delivery person for taking your waste.
Alternatively, you can take the metal to a local transfer station. Add your ZIP Code in Earth911’s Recycling Search to find nearby options.
Running Belt
The running belt is the part that your feet hit while you’re running or walking. As a treadmill owner, you’ve probably replaced this part a few times and loosened it to add lubricant and then had to tighten it back up. The belt is very durable and not easily recyclable because it a composite of several different materials, but it’s ripe for upcycling.
You can cut your running belt into pieces with a utility knife. Use it as a rugged mat in the garage or workshop. Stack a few pieces on top of each other to use as a doormat or a mudroom rug. It’s also great to put under a litter box to prevent litter from tracking around the home. Look around your home for where else you might need a tough mat.
Running Board
Below the running belt is the running board, usually a large piece of plywood, often painted black. This wood is also great for upcycling into wall art, a table, a desk, shelving, or maybe a kid’s play car layout. If you’re not the crafty type, offer this piece to any artist you know and they’ll make it beautiful or drop it a transfer station for recycling.
Electronics
Unless your treadmill is completely manual, it will have some wiring and circuit boards under the buttons and screens. The display and control panel along with the wiring can be recycled as e-waste.
Even manual treadmills usually have a battery-powered monitor for tracking your time and distance; be sure to recycle this unit with your e-waste. You can check for e-waste recycling locations near you using Earth911 Recycling Search, just enter your ZIP code.
Plastics
The last cast-offs from your treadmill are likely to be hard plastic parts. They will take the most effort to recycle or upcycle. The plastic handle grips and the surround for your electronics have worked hard and taken a beating to support your calorie burn: Make an effort to keep them out of the landfill.
Although you won’t be likely to find a plastic resin number on these parts, you may be able to find a local plastic recycler that accepts rigid plastics. It’s a good idea to call a recycler to confirm they’ll accept these pieces before you make the trip to drop them off.
You might also consider offering the plastic components for free on swap sites to other treadmill users whose parts have broken. If neither of these options works, consider upcycling. Look at these pieces for their repurposing potential as well as their artistic potential. Can you paint the handles and transform them into vases? Can you store ropes or hoses inside that empty console in your garage?
Do you plan on replacing that treadmill with a new one? Consider a manual treadmill for a good workout without consuming electricity! (If you make a purchase through this link, Earth911 receives a small commission that helps fund our recycling database.)

Plastic #4 Explained

It is important to recycle LDPE plastic whenever possible because it can remain in landfills or the environment for hundreds of years. LDPE bags are a better option for food packaging than its sibling material, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) because it requires less material than HDPE. However, LDPE is not widely accepted by recycling programs due to risks to workers and machines if the plastic film causes a jam.
When you separate your #4 LDPE bags and send them to organicgirl, the benefits include reduced energy and raw materials use, as well as greater safety for recycling workers.
Sustainability Benefits of Recycling organicgirl #4 LDPE Bag Packaging

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, only 8.3 percent of LDPE plastic is recycled in the United States as of 2017, and another 15.8 percent is incinerated to generate energy. Recycling LDPE requires about 28 percent of the energy used to make plastic from virgin materials.

Recovered from an Injury? Learn How to Recycle Old Medical Gear,"If you or someone you know gets injured, it often means stocking up on medical gear such as crutches, braces, boots, and walkers. And while you’re usually elated once those devices are no longer needed, what to do with them after the injury heals can be a bit of a head-scratcher.
Reader Sara Wise posed this recycling query to us on Facebook after her grandson recovered from injuries sustained during a car accident. If you’ve also wondered about what to do with old medical gear, read on for a few recycling solutions.
Before we get into individual items, it’s worth noting that there is an abundance of online marketplaces (such OfferUp, Nextdoor, and Craigslist) that you can use to donate or even sell products you no longer need. With the rising costs of healthcare, don’t be surprised if you can actually make a few bucks selling your medical aids.
Crutches
Crutches are largely made of aluminum, one of the most valuable materials you can recycle. As a result, most scrap metal recyclers will accept them and pay you a small fee. But before you take that route, a surprising number of organizations will gladly take your gently used crutches and distribute them to others in need.
Crutches 4 Africa, an international project of the Mountain Foothills Rotary Club in Evergreen, Colorado, collects gently used crutches and distributes them to those with physical challenges (such as polio survivors) in Africa. The organization also accepts canes, walkers, and wheelchairs, and they’ve distributed more than 171,000 devices to 24 African countries and 14 developing countries so far.
Based in New York City, the nonprofit Crutches 4 Kids collects both child- and adult-sized crutches and gives them to physically disabled children around the world. The organization offers drop-off locations for used crutches in New York, New Jersey, and soon, Massachusetts. And if you’re feeling extra generous, you can ship them from any FedEx store for $20.
San Francisco–based ReCares collects used durable medical equipment, such as crutches, canes, wheelchairs, and walkers, and gives them to low-income elderly residents. The organization offers collection points in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Rafael, California.
World Crutches offers an extensive list of organizations that are happy to receive crutches and other mobility equipment. Most of these organizations offer the equipment to people who need it for no charge, and some sell the equipment for a reduced fee.
If none of these organizations offer drop-off locations near you, look into local secondhand stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army. Other possible donation options include hospice, churches, and senior centers. Just be sure to call ahead first so you don’t waste a trip.
Wheelchairs, walkers, and scooters
Wheelchairs, walkers, and scooters are in high demand, and many people who need these items cannot afford them — meaning you can make a big difference with your donation.
A service for residents of Massachusetts, REquipment accepts gently used durable medical equipment, ranging from wheelchairs and scooters to sling lifts and shower chairs. They make minor repairs as needed and help get the equipment into the hands of adults, children, and elders who live in the state.
A Disabled American Veterans chapter in Minnesota established a local service called the Donor Connect Program to connect people who have used medical equipment with veterans who need it. This program does not accept electric scooters or wheelchairs.
The Wheelchair Foundation maintains a list of nearly 20 other organizations that will accept used wheelchairs. In most cases, they will be refurbished and donated, and pick-up can be arranged.
For other nationwide options, try your local Goodwill or Salvation Army location. They will gladly accept wheelchairs, walkers, and scooters, as will local churches, community centers, rehab facilities, and shelters.
If your wheelchair or scooter is electric and no longer works, you can likely recycle it via a local e-waste recycler. Walkers are made primarily of aluminum, so scrap metal recyclers will generally accept them and pay you a small fee.
Boots and braces
Boots and braces are typically less durable than other medical supplies and come in much closer contact with the skin — making them more challenging to donate. Some nonprofits will not accept used boots and braces for these reasons, but you can still find a way to keep them from going to waste.
Two national organizations will accept orthopedic supplies, including boots, braces, and slings: Samaritan’s Purse and MedShare. In both cases, you can ship materials, but you’ll need to fill out a donation form first to confirm acceptance.
You can also try donating your used boots and braces to a neighborhood church, senior center, community center, or shelter, or stop by your local Goodwill or Salvation Army chapter.
There aren’t really any viable recycling options for boots and braces because they don’t contain enough metal and the contact with human skin limits the recycling markets for the plastic and fabric elements.

A How-To Guide on Recycling Household Items,"No matter how hard you try to recycle and reuse certain items, chances are you are still throwing too much away. Even if you are an avid recycler, there are always ways in which you can improve. With a little creative thinking and a commitment to going above and beyond when it comes to recycling, you will be able to get the most out of those household items you otherwise would have tossed.
Whether you are an avid DIY-er or simply looking for new ways to reuse and repurpose some of those common household items you normally just recycle, we’ve got your bases covered. With the help of this list, you will be able to  avoid spending money you cannot spare and be proud of yourself for reusing things and cutting down on national waste.
Below you will find a list of everyday objects that are normally recycled or thrown away and some ways that you can transform them into useful, fun objects.

Dish Soap Bottles
Once you get the bottom of your dish soap bottle – or any squeeze bottle, really – clean it out thoroughly and set it out to dry. You can then use the old dish bottle as a vessel for water to hydrate out-of-the-way plants, or even for cooking purposes.
Egg Cartons
Egg cartons also moonlight as a container for freezing individual portions of all kind of things – such as cookie dough batter, meatballs, homemade herb-butter, and more. Another fun idea is to use egg cartons as an organizational tool. You can store items such as golf balls, or even separate out your change in an easy and efficient way.
Paper Bags
There are many different uses for paper sacks, some of which you may not have thought of before. Try fastening one to the back of your front passenger seat and use it as a wastepaper basket for your children. If someone in your family is sick with a cold, it could be helpful to fasten a paper bag to the side of the mattress so that they can easy discard their used tissues.
Bottle Caps
There are many different uses for bottle caps, many of which may surprise you. If you have a dent in your wooden table, simply cover the area with a wet cloth, put a metal bottle cap over it with the fluted edge facing upward, then press the center of the cap lightly with the tip of a hot iron. It is important to note that the bottle cap should not be facing down toward the table. Another idea is to create a shoe scraper for outside the door using six or eight rows of bottle caps. Simple name them into an 8-by-12 inch board with the sharp side facing upward. This is a great project to do with your kids, or when you have a spare hour or so.
Paper Towel Rolls
If you have a lot of plastic bags on your hands, a good way to keep them contained is by stuffing them in an empty paper towel roll. You can also use used paper towel rolls to keep extension cords untangled by rolling them up and putting them through the center of the roll. Other uses of these oftentimes discarded rolls is to use them to organize hair ties and hair clips, or even roll your linens around paper towel rolls to keep them crease-free.
Hopefully these five ideas will inspire you to reuse some of those common household items that you normally recycle or toss. And again, if you have any other fun, eco-friendly ideas to reduce waste, feel free to share!
